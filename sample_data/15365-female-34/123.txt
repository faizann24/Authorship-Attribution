record scratches on the harmonica solo   Grieving myself into I box, I saw the sun through narrow slits, and clouds forming and the voices of all the arms around me drawing near, too near.  Each is in her own stage of dying down the mattered ways of age and giving up something for lent.  A thousand opportunities to grow and close and dance alone as one,  the dust rising from the road below his feet,  as thunder invites the rain forward in time.  Beasts and burdens, the bud opening again and again rather than giving up the flower pot.  A daisy in your hair or a paper airplane and still these questions slam dunk, rock the surface of the walls until the paint peels off like wallpaper and  someone is still not here.  No fortune left to chance as the craving of the ring moves like shadows on the movie theater wall, tickles the projectionist for a moment, then moves on.  And we are not the wind. And we are not the sail. And we are not the ship, the bow, the galley.  And we are not the passing hour, the memory of yesterday's tomorrow. muddled through, hands still clenching like a baby's fist.  Knowing who you are is all the more reason to fight the form, only half of what could be if letting go were that easy.  Merge me into your flesh and give me a reason to stay in the now longer than a blink.  Welcome me home, distracting the ending one more time.
