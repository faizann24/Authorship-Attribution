urlLink April 2003 Outlook from Moonsurfing.com   Dear Moonsurfers,  The Moon is New in Aries on Tuesday April 1st at 11:19 AM PST. Happy Lunar New Year!   Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Mars is closer to earth than it's been in 79,000 years!  The pressure to handle this planet's energy was never stronger. The high road for this energy is that of the sacred warrior while the low road reminds us that when colored with fear, assertion can become aggression. This New Moon in Aries brings you golden opportunities to redefine and redirect the way you use this personally assertive energy. Here's the cosmic context.  The Sun, Moon, and Mercury are partying in Aries, so blunt speech, as in speaking without thinking could make you the April Fool.  Use the quick-paced mental skills of Mercury's presence in Aries to think before you speak and come up with positive loving scenarios and brilliant win-win solutions. Channel your energy into positive avenues that support your self-confidence.  Get ready for a shot of growth and optimism as Jupiter turns direct on April 3rd after a retrograde period that started on Dec. 4th.  This gave you an opportunity to look at the things in your life that you don't want expanding.  Eliminate these with the help of Spirit as Jupiter movesforward and the spark you ignite with your intentions can grow  quickly.   Mars, the ruling planet of this Aries New Moon, currently travels through Capricorn and unites exactly with Chiron while squaring the Moon, Sun, Capricorn. What this means is that action will be taken and there will be some changes made. Use your energy efficiently and, when old wounds come up, remain open to alternative ways of dealing and healing.    This New Moon is a gift of enormous personal creative energy from the universe to use as you wish, so step forward boldly and courageously hand in hand and heart to heart with Spirit. Claim the adventure that is your life and make of it what you desire. Remember that old Chinese proverb that says, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."                   Wishing you a Gloriously Creative New Moon,                                                            Claudia
