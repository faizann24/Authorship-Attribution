VIRGO LUNAR CYCLE  Aug 27 - Sep 24, 2003  The New Moon in Virgo on August 27 begins a 29.6-day cycle about developing  analytical skills , a  sense of discrimination  and the  ability to recognize patterns . This preparatory stage in the process of our development gives us time to improve our situation by attending to details. The simple rituals of daily life will provide the grounding necessary for balance. This is an especially good period to work on the mind-body connection.   Analyze and adjust daily routines to support physical and mental well being. Good health, altruistic service and productive employment support success; practicality and prudence guarantee it. Use this cycle to  refine  and  revise  the spark of intention you ignited last spring. It's time to redesign the form the future will take.   Mercury is Retrograde  from (Aug 28-Sept 20). Retrograde means redo, rethink, rewrite, revaluate, revisit, and reanalyze. Over the next three weeks we will have the opportunity to see what needs changing in work, health, finances, and life. Mercury loves to play hide-and-go-seek with every area of communication including, travel, cars, (traffic jams), computers, break downs, and lost items.  This creates an environment of whacky, crazy-making events and mishaps. Timing is everything! If you can wait, do not sign anything until after September 20th, your patience will pay off.   Mercury is the Messenger to the gods (archetypes).  He travels freely between worlds your conscious mind (the part of you reading this right now), and the subconscious (that which is just below the threshold of your awareness) i.e., dreams, true desires, wishes. And, the unconscious mind, the unknown part of Self made conscious through others, by mirroring back to us what is deeply hidden both light, and dark.    All of life is energy.  I am energy. You are energy. The personal and planetary astrology represents the energy patterns in motion we are currently utilizing (working with) consciously or unconsciously.  We live cycles within cycles.  With the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter the planet of wealth, blessings, gifts from the gods, and expansion, moving into Virgo also, where Jupiter will stay for the next year, we are invited to heal our health and advance our careers. Watch for making mountains(Jupiter) out of molehills (Virgo). We are building towards the fullmoon.  Plant your seeds (New Moon) and prepare for the harvest (Full Moon).         In this cycle of Virgo perfection, why not practice being  "unconditionally constructive"  that is no self-criticism or criticism of others, continuously focus on the positive, if we send out positive energy we will get back positive results, this is the Law of Attraction.  What is working in your life?  Instead of getting caught up in the negatives and fueling frustration, why not  express gratitude  for your blessings and practice the Law of Allowing.   Explore this Virgo cycle deeply and the secrets of financial/personal success.  Money is not the root of all-evil.  It is what we do with it!  We must evolve beyond the fear of money, sense of limitation, and struggle.  The power (global) elite are crumbling!  We the people are winning. As bad as things may seem, events are minuscule compared to what was seen (prophesized). We are moving into the light (energy) of the fifth dimension, a vibration of love, compassion and abundance.   Monthly Affirmation:  I serve the highest good through Love. I filter information without judgment. I find perfection in the moment.  Interpretation by  urlLink Zodiac Arts  and  urlLink Kelley Rosano
