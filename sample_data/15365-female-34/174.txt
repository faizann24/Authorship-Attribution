urlLink TAURUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Dana Gerhardt @  urlLink http://www.mooncircles.com   April 19 - May 20  This New Moon brings a partial Solar Eclipse. Eclipses bring a dramatic acceleration or sudden turn of events. What has recently changed for you? Eclipses force much needed changes to the surface. Their shakedown makes it easier to release worn-out behaviors, attitudes and relationships. Their  turbulence impels us to grow .    This New Moon is particularly potent. It is the second New Moon in Aries this year. Wasat the Aries New Moon last monthyour inner heroic nature roused to action? You may have found that what was stagnant in your life was becoming unbearable. Spring is about initiating action. Leaves suddenly fill out bare branches. Hyacinth and tulip bulbs shoot up from the ground.  Where have you been springing forth?  This is the second cycle of Artemisgoddess of the Moon and goddess of the hunt. She is summoned in each of us this season, expressed in our joyous independence, in our nurturing and courageous action.   Perhaps the most important resolve you might make this New Moon is to shift your focus from what you dont wanton to what you do.  Your future will be created by what you place your mind on now.  If youre focused on irritations or lack, you will get more of the same. If you fill your heart with winning feelings, if you  fill your mind with images of success , the momentum towards a brighter future will build. Negative energy only brings more negativity. The tulip bulb shooting up from the earth doesnt think "I dont want more winter." It is thinking "I want to be a luscious bloom." When you do likewise this cycle, a resplendent future will be speeding your way.
