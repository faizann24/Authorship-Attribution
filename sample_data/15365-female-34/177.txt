From: KnowledgeNews  info@knowledgenews.net >  Prepare to be mooned--blue mooned.  This Saturday, July 31, a "blue moon" rises.  Of course, you probably won't see even a hint of blue color, just your average full moon. So what gives? What's so blue about a moon that isn't? Heck, astronomers even say that blue moons aren't rare. And folklorists say they're not what everyone thinks they are.  As any budding astronomer can tell you, a "blue moon" is the second full moon in a calendar month. It isn't really blue. It's just a name. But why, of all things, do we call a white moon "blue" Actually, there are truly blue moons.   In 1883, an Indonesian volcano erupted with the force of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb. With a roar heard nearly 400 miles (over 600 kilometers) away, Mount Krakatoa belched a column of volcanic gas and ash into the atmosphere. That night, the moon rose blue over Indonesia. Particles from Krakatoa's ash, not more than a micron wide, made it happen. These micron-wide particles were exactly the right size to scatter red light, while allowing other colors, such as blue, to pass. The result: a blue sphere hanging in the sky. Different sized particles filtered other colors and caused different effects. In fact, for several years after the eruption, there were reports fro mall over the globe of red moons, green moons, and, yes, even more blue moons..   What's more, some of the sunsets following the eruption were such a blazing red that people actually called on firemen to drown the optical illusion.. The eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo produced the same anomaly.&nbsp; So have forest fires.&nbsp;Still, none of this explains why we call the second full moon in a month a blue moon. The phrase is old, even if the modern meaning is not. Before Shakespeare penned a word of Hamlet, the English knew little couplets like: If they say the moon is blewe, we must believe that it is true.
