urlLink Storage Ideas :  A large garbage can may be covered with a round plywood top, draped with a round skirt and pronto -- storage for a variety of household items.  Ladders or step stools topped with shelves or a flush door table top provide storage space, display area, desk or work surface.  Adding legs and cushions to a door or other flat board makes a bench, bed or sofa. Casters may also be used in place of legs. Without the cushions, you have a movable plant stand to display collections, books or records.  Bricks (stone, concrete or glass) and boards can be used for bookshelves, shoe shelves, end tables, coffee tables and plant stands.  Use five-sided cubes for a number of things. A basic 15-inch cube made of plywood can be a coffee table, an end table, a storage unit, a cushioned seat or almost anything you like, and in any color because it is easy to paint or enamel. Brightly painted cubes lined up along the floor of a child's room will hold books and toys. Stack them up in your family room to hold books, small TV, stereo equipment, and decorative objects. Stacked units can be used for a two-faced room divider with open sides facing either way.  Storage containers can be made from boxes, tin cans, baskets or other recycled containers. These can be painted, covered with self-adhesive paper, wallpaper, fabric. Sturdy old tables, chests or storage units can look attractive through refinishing, painting, application of self-adhesive paper or upholstering with easily-cared-for fabric.   New or used filing cabinets may be used in a variety of ways to provide an abundance of storage. Cover them with fabric, wallpaper or a coat of paint to make them more attractive.
