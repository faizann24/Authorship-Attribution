Least Complicated  Words and Music: Emily Saliers,  urlLink Indigo Girls    I sit two stories above the street It's awful quiet here since love fell asleep There's life down below me though  the kids are walking home from school So long ago when we were taught  That for whatever kind of puzzle you got You just stick the right formula in a solution for every fool  I remember the time when I came so close to you Sent me skipping my class and running from school And I bought you that ring cause I never was cool What makes me think I can start clean-slated? The hardest to learn was the least complicated  So I just sit up in the house and resist And not be seen until I cease to exist A kind of conscientious objection a kind of dodging the draft Boy and girl are holding hands in the street And I don't want to but I'll think you just wait It's more than just eye to eye learn things I could never apply  I remember the time I came so close with you  I let everything go it seemed the only truth And I bought you that ring it seemed the thing to do  What makes me think I can start clean-slated? The hardest to learn was the least complicated What makes me think I can start clean-slated? The hardest to learn was the least complicated  Oh I'm just a mirror of a mirror of myself All the things I do And the next time I fall I'm going to have to recall It isn't love it's only something new
