urlLink Seal: Fast Changes   Maybe if I search my mind a little, I'd come across the reason why you're gone. Maybe if I searched a little while. And if I try to reconcile a little, Then maybe I will know for how long. This time... Well here we are, in separate rooms. I can hear you sighing. Saying "No way out" or so it seems.
