"Move On" (solo version) from Sunday in the Park with George                                                 Stop worrying where you're going, move on                                             If you can know where you're going, you've gone                                                       Just keep moving on.                                               I chose, and my world was shaken--so what?                                                  The choice may have been mistaken                                                       but choosing was not.                                                       You have to move on.                                                       Look at what you want,                                                       Not at where you are,                                                       Not at what you'll be.                                                Look at all the things you've done for me:                                                        Opened up my eyes                                                       Taught me how to see                                                        Notice every tree!                                                       Understand the light!                                                       Concentrate on now!                                                       I want to move on . . .                                                     I want to explore the light.                                                  I want to know how to get through                                                     through to something new--                                                       Something of my own!                                                            Move on!                                                           Move on!                                                   Stop worrying if your vision is new.                                                   Let others make that decision . . .                                                         they usually do!                                                       You keep moving on.                                                      Look at what you want,                                                        Not at what you are                                                       Not at what you'll be                                                 Look at all the things you gave to me.                                              See what's in my eyes, And the color of my hair,                                                     and the way it catches light.                                                    And the care, and the feeling                                                      And the light, moving on!                                                    We've always belonged together.                                                   We will always belong together!                                                       Just keep moving on.                                                 Anything you do, let it come from you--                                                        then it will be new.                                                       Give us more to see.
