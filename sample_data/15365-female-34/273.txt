Osho Zen Tarot   Patience                        We have forgotten how to wait; it is almost an abandoned space. And it is our greatest                       treasure to be able to wait for the right moment. The whole existence waits for the right                       moment. Even trees know it--when it is time to bring the flowers and when it is time to let go                       of all the leaves and stand naked against the sky. They are still beautiful in that nakedness,                       waiting for the new foliage with a great trust that the old has gone, and the new will soon be                       coming, and the new leaves will start growing. We have forgotten to wait, we want                       everything in a hurry. It is a great loss to humanity.... In silence and waiting something inside                       you goes on growing--your authentic being. And one day it jumps and becomes a flame, and                       your whole personality is shattered; you are a new man. And this new man knows what                       ceremony is, this new man knows life's eternal juices.                         There are times when the only thing to do is to wait. The seed has been planted, the child is                       growing in the womb, the oyster is coating the grain of sand and making it into a pearl. This  card reminds us that now is a time when all that is required is to be simply alert, patient, waiting. The woman pictured here is  in just such an attitude. Contented, with no trace of anxiety, she is simply waiting. Through all the phases of the moon  passing overhead she remains patient, so in tune with the rhythms of the moon that she has almost become one with it. She  knows it is a time to be passive, letting nature take its course. But she is neither sleepy nor indifferent; she knows it is time to  be ready for something momentous. It is a time full of mystery, like the hours just before the dawn. It is a time when the only  thing to do is to wait.
