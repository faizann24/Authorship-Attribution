urlLink Beautiful - Christina Aguilera   Don't look at me...   Everyday is so wonderful  Then suddenly  It's hard to breathe  Now and then I get insecure  From all the pain  I'm so ashamed   I am beautiful  No matter what they say  Words can't bring me down  I am beautiful  In every single way  Yes words can't bring me down  So don't you bring me down today   To all your friends  You're delirious  So consumed  In all your doom  Trying hard to fill the emptiness  The pieces gone  Left the puzzle undone  Is that the way it is   You are beautiful  No matter what they say  Words can't bring you down  Cause you are beautiful  In every single way  Yes words can't bring you down  So don't you bring me down today   No matter what we do  No matter what we say  We're the song inside the tune  Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go  The sun will always shine  And tomorrow we might awake on the other side   Cause we are beautiful  No matter what they say  Yes words won't bring us down, no  We are beautiful in every single way  Yes words can't bring us down  So don't you bring me down today
