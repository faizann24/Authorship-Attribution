Soundtrack: Moulin Rouge (2001)   Never knew I could feel like this Like I've never seen the sky before I want to vanish inside your kiss Every day I'm loving you more and more Listen to my heart, can you hear it sings Telling me to give you everything Seasons may change, winter to spring But I love you untill the end of time  * Come what may Come what may I will love you until my dying day  Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste It all revolves around you And there's no mountain too high No river too wide Sing out this song I'll be there by your side Storm clouds may gather And stars may collide But I love you until the end of time (Repeat *)  Oh, come what may, come what may I will love you, I will love you Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
