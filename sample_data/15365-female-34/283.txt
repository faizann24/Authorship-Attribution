urlLink Help for Cravings and Tough Situations    What to Do Right Now and to Create a Smoke-free Future     For the first few days after you quit, spend as much free time as possible    in places where smoking is prohibited - libraries, museums, theaters,    churches.     Drink a lot of water and fruit juice.     Don't drink alcohol, coffee, and other beverages that you associate with    smoking.     Strike up a conversation instead of a match for a cigarette.     If you miss the feeling of having a cigarette in your hand, play with    something else - a pencil, a paperclip, a marble.     If you miss the feeling of having something in your mouth, try toothpicks,    cinnamon sticks or celery.     AVOID TEMPTATION by staying away from situations you associate with    pleasurable smoking.     FIND NEW HABITS and create a non-smoking environment around you.     Keep from picking up the habit again by anticipating future    situations/crises that might make you want to smoke again, and remind yourself    of your reasons to not give in.     Take deep rhythmic breaths similar to smoking to relax.     Remember your goal and the fact that the urge will eventually pass.     Think positive thoughts and avoid negative ones.     Brush your teeth.     Do brief bursts of exercise (isometrics, pushups, deep knee bends, walk up    a flight of stairs, or touch your toes).     Call a supportive friend.
