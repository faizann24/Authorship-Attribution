Site du Jour of the Day (030214) February 14, 2003   urlLink spamradio   Richard Airlie Ian Morrison spamradio project London, England  Most of us have the pleasure of wading through a lot of rubbish when check our e-mail. Unsolicited messages sent out to the world and his brother all attempting to sell us diet products, help us whisk away funds from small failing governments and more. Perhaps even purchase unwashed and unseeded e-mail addresses by the bushel so we can pitch our own dog and pony shows. Spam is what these unsolicited messages are called.  Finally somebody has done something about the problem  they have put these intrusive words to music. The music is performed by the likes of the main, thecrashkid, aereal, tweeter, idmonster, lackluster, mosaik, pretty boy crossover and sense with additional music by Ian Morrison. The words are from so many different sources it is difficult to take count or determine point of origin. Not for the faint of heart, minors, or other individuals who are offended by the content of unsolicited e-mail messages. Some have adult themes, most offers are either too silly or too good to be true. Thanks to Jeff Stachowski for the wiggly suggestion.
