urlLink Gather the Women  Beginning the week of March 3-8, 2003,  linked globally by our interactive website, we are inviting women to demonstrate  their courage to risk leaving old conformities  by joining with millions of others throughout the world  in thousands of unique events celebrating woman's true worth,  expressing shared concern for our human family,  and creating and supporting actions  that will enable humanity to live together  in a world based on life-affirming values.  Gather the Women is evoking at a profound level  an experience of our own woman's worth to the world.   As women we bring life forward.  We are in touch with the cycles of life and we function in a context that is deeply relational.  This realization is allowing women to risk leaving  the safety of our comfortable conformities.  We have the capacity to generate  creative solutions that benefit  all life on the planet.  Gather the Women is creating  a rich exchange of cultural values  to dissolve the ties that bind us to the illusion  that one segment of our human family can win  while another loses.  Together we women are contributing  to a new collective wisdom  and we are lending our strength  to that which we wish to embrace.  From this emerging balance is being born  a new dimension of our humanity.
