urlLink PERSONAL MINISTRY: Advancing God's Kingdom  TOOLS OF THE TRADE Message # 4: (Selected Scriptures) Taught by Dr. Larry Osborne North Coast Church January 30 & 31, 1999  As in all families, joining God's family brings with it certain responsibilities. And one of our most important responsibilities is to help advance God's Kingdom. But how can we determine the specific assignment and role God has for us? That's what we'll discover today as we explore the importance of a personal ministry and the special tools called spiritual gifts that make it possible to carry out that ministry.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FAMILY CHORES    We all have a unique set of God given gifts, skills and resources.   I Corinthians 12:1 & 7/ I Corinthians 4:7/ James 1:17  We are responsible to use them to advance God's Kingdom.    I Peter 4:10-12/ Matthew 25:14-30 & Luke 19:11-27  If we don't use them, we lose them. Advancing God's Kingdom is NOT optional.  The goal is to match what we do best with where we're needed most.             WHAT DO I DO BEST? Discovering Our Spiritual Gift Mix   1) Our spiritual gifts may or may not match our passions and desires.                     Exodus 3:1-4:18/ I Chronicles 26:16-20  You can miss out on what God has for you by pursuing your desires.  2) Giftedness is based upon God's sovereignty not our spirituality.                     Romans 12:6 & I Corinthians 12:4-6/ I Timothy 1:12-16  3) The greater the glory, the less important the gift.       I Corinthians 12:21-26    4) The best way to discover our spiritual gifts is to do something and then check the result.       Matthew 25:14-30, Luke 19:11-27   WHERE AM I NEEDED MOST? Discovering Our God Given Assignment   THREE TOUGH QUESTIONS:  1) Do I have the right paradigm? (viewpoint) Am I looking at this properly? Am I out to win the war or am I being self-indulgent?  2) Do I have the right goal? Is my goal to serve the Lord or is it self fulfillment? Was your service hard or did it just make you feel good?  3) Am I making a real impact?       Matthew 26:36-45  When? Where? How?
