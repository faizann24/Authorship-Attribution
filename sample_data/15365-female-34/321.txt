Shining true being: Meditation for the Dying  Imagine that your body no longer has the strength, the energy, to maintain its connection with the life-force, with the body of awareness within. And imagine now that you are beginning to experience the process of dissolving out of that body. Sensations from the body no longer so distinct, melting away, leaving just a spaciousness. Dissolving out of the body. Leaving that heavier form behind. Dissolving into consciousness itself.  My friend, listen now, for that which is called death has arrived. So let go gently, gently, of all that holds you back. Of all that pulls you away from this most precious moment. Know that now you have arrived at the transition called death. Open to it. Let go into it.   Recognise the changing experience of the mind as it separates from the body, dissolving.   Dissolving now into the realms of pure light. Your true nature shining everywhere before you.   My friend, maintain an open-heartedness, a spaciousness of being that does not grasp. Let things be as they are without the least attempt to interfere. Grasping at nothing.   Enter the essential nature of your own being shining there before you, a great luminosity. Rest in being. Knowing it for what it is. This light shining, luminous. Your true self.   Let go, gently, gently, without the least force. Before you shines your true being. It is without birth, without death.   Let go of all which distracts or confuses the mind, all that created density in life.   Go gently into it. Do not be frightened or bewildered. Do not pull back in fear from the immensity of your true being. Now is a moment for liberation.   Know that you are well guided by your compassion and love. You are the essence of all things. You are the light.   From 'Who Dies?' by Stephen Levine.
