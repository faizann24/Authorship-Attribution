For Each of You  Be who you are and will be learn to cherish that boistrous Black Angel that drives you up one day and down another protecting the place where your power rises running like hot blood from the same source as your pain.  When you are hungry learn to eat whatever sustains you until morning but do not be misled by details simply because you live them.  Do not let your head deny your hands any memory of what passes through them nor your eyes nor your heart everything can be useful except what is wasteful (you will need  to remember this when you are accused of destruction.) Even when they are dangerous examine the heart of those machines you hate before you discard them and never mourn the lack of their power lest you be condemned to relive them. If you do not learn to hate you will never be lonely  enough to love easily nor will you always be brave although it does not grow any easier  Do not pretend to convenient beliefs even when they are righteous you will never be able to defend your city while shouting.  Remember our sun is not the most noteworthy star only the nearest.  Respect whatever pain you bring back from your dreaming but do not look for new gods in the sea nor in any part of a rainbow Each time you love love as deeply as if it were  forever only nothing is  eternal.  Speak proudly to your children where ever you may find them tell them you are the offspring of slaves and your mother was a princess in darkness.  - Audre Lorde in From a Land Where Other People Live
