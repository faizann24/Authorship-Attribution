urlLink Desiderata   Go placidly amid the noise and haste And remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender,  Be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others,  Even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons;  They are vexatious to the spirit.   If you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter,  For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your career, however humble;  It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.   Exercise caution in your business affairs,  For the world is full of trickery But let this not blind you to what virtue there is.  Many persons strive for high ideals  And everywhere life is full of heroism.   Be yourself.  Especially do not feign affection, Neither be cynical about love,  For in the face of all aridity and disappointment  It is as perennial as the grass.   Take kindly the counsel of the years,  Gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.   Beyond a wholesome discipline be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars.  You have a right to be here. And whether it is clear to you or not,  No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God,  Whatever you conceive him to be,  And whatever your labours and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life,  Keep peace with your soul.   With all its sham and drudgery and broken dreams  It is still a beautiful world.  Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.   Max Ehrman, 1927 Found in Old Saint Paul's Church, Baltimore, U.S.A. Dated 1692
