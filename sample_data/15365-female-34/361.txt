urlLink Impossible Dream : To dream the impossible dream To fight the unbeatable foe To bear with unbearable sorrow And to run where  the brave dare not go To right the unrightable wrong And to love pure and chaste from afar To try when your arms are too weary To reach the unreachable star  This is my quest To follow that star No matter how hopeless No matter how far To fight for the right Without question or pause To be willing to march,  march into hell For that heavenly cause And I know If I'll only be true To this glorious quest That my heart Will lie peaceful and calm When I'm laid to my rest  And the world will be  better for this That one man, scorned  and covered with scars, Still strove with his last  ounce of courage To reach the unreachable,  the unreachable, The unreachable star And I'll always dream The impossible dream Yes, and I'll reach The unreachable star.
