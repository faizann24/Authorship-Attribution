urlLink Osho Zen Tarot :   "Life is rarely as serious as we believe it to be, and when we recognize this fact, it responds by giving us more and more opportunities to play. "  "The indecisive and dualistic aspect of the mind asks should I let my arms go and fall head-first, or let my legs go and fall feet-first? Should I go here or there? Should I say yes or no? And whatever decision we make, we will always wonder if we should have decided the other way. The only way out of this dilemma is, unfortunately, to let go of both at once. You can't work your way out of this one by solving it, making lists of pros and cons, or in any way working it out with your mind. Better to follow your heart, if you can find it. If you can't find it, just jump--your heart will start beating so fast there will be no mistake about where it is!"  "Drop your opinionated mind and move inside. There, you can relax into your own deepest truth, where the difference between dreams and reality is already known."
