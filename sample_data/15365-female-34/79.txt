CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE   Silence starting and already I imagine trips to the mailbox, but what the fuck, and why  am I missing something here that has kept my mouth shut tight like duct tape over lips against a terrorist threat.  Light another. Smoke another.  Get this out of my head and down where I can understand nothing better than big talk from someone else,  while I sit and observe, while I sit and perceive.  I am whipped into submission by my reflection.  My tawdry alter ego, the no show, readied for my finale as a failure and no head for numbers, so what will become of me...  I have three days left before I can be myself again and nobody will be there on the other side to hear it.  What have I done and why should I care if I don't don't care when I'm my own nurse writing prescriptions, before the Third Bardo.  For all the promises made to send to me, now will the letters come?  What do you care and why should you care when I am just another stranger or reminder that you have heard everything before and probably said much better.  Is that jealousy?  I have nothing to offer but breath and that which comes natural to dissipate every energy landing here.  Doubt, fear, shame.  This is nothing to contribute and I can't get by on my tits, my looks faded at 5 years old and I'm lucky to hear cute anymore.  Responsible, dependable me.  Why can't I just be alone where no shadows play across the walls I don't cast myself.  Why can't I just be alone and not hear your voice or wonder and wait by the mailbox for something not coming out here now to tell me the truth.  4:05 AM Friday, June 27, 2003
