CLUES AND ILLUSIONS   At this point it doesn't really matter what I say to sound coming off like a nothing, something, maybe more or less, not.  These images flash, and I am unsure again of who I  was when I was what I was,  to be found this close to home without a conscience carved in honest mistakes.  Best wait for something resembling silence to take the place of feeling out of place, pointed at.  No competition is worth having.  We were meaning something even I can't understand;  like a song going through your head that won't quit and singing it to someone else only makes it worse.  A spotlight on the stage or behind walls is more or less the same.  Burn out the light by leaving it on too long or shadow this crevasse into camouflage.  It makes no difference.  Words must come out somewhere after all and targets are slow to come by.  To know oneself as a monster and angel containing equal parts is a poorly bargained balance.  Deny nothing. Keep to yourself.  Keep your hands in the car at all times.  Rhetoric and righteousness from too shaky a foundation, is roughness  and  sand castles.  What could you have been if you had just been you, if you'd only known that then?  Who else do you expect to forgive and forget the truth of  too much from too much?  It all comes out in the wash said someone helping even now, in ways I can not see, in ways I can not see.
