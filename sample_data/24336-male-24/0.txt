I wish I was back in high school for this one:   urlLink Wireless Networking for the TI graphing calculators .  Back in high school, our graphing calculators full of games saved some of our sanity.  We went so far as to create Tetris tournaments.  I went so far as to create games in BASIC for the TI-85, then to learn assembly for the TI-92.  I never did get enough knowledge of the TI-92 to create games, but that knowledge did help me out with my college course in assembly.
