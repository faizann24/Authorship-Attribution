Looking for a  new computer?  Looking for a very small new computer?  The  urlLink Espresso PC  is about the size of a large graphing calculator.  I would be afraid of losing that thing.  The cost is prohibitive since it uses mostly notebook parts.  Less expensive (but much larger) is the  urlLink BookPC .  This uses normal PC parts in a footprint about the size of a phonebook.  Neither of these systems are very upgradeable (Cannot upgrade anything on the Espresso, cannot put any new cards into the Book), but neither is the very popular  urlLink iMac !  Got to install one of the new DV models yesterday, and it could not be much easier.
