Michigan State (3-3) at (16) Michigan (5-2) Player to Watch: Ryan Van Dyke, QB, Michigan State. Starter has struggled since returning from injury and even got replaced last week by Jeff Smoker.  Breakdown: Both sides are issuing the standard spin about this being a tough rivalry game, but reality says it's a mismatch. Despite their 3-0 start, the Spartans clearly are in a rebuilding year following a 10-2 campaign in 1999. The only consistency is RB T.J. Duckett, the nation's No. 5 rusher (148.3 yards). Michigan exploded in a 58-0 win last week and will likely go right at the Spartans' wobbly defensive front with powerful RB Anthony Thomas.
