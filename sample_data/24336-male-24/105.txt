The big decision looms:  Do I stick with crappy IDE hardware, or do I start to upgrade to SCSI?  The new  urlLink PleXWriter PX-W1210S  cd burner is 12x/10x/32x and SCSI.  The IDE version of the same has been a top drive for some time.  With SCSI, upgrading is easy.  With IDE, the price is actually reasonable.  Plextor IDE: $250.   Plextor SCSI:  $380 .   That just made up my mind.
