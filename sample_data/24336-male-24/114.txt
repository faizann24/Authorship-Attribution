The FDA is getting in the way of the  urlLink Digital Angel .  The DA is a small box that is powered by body heat that acts as a GPS unit.  Originally, the plan was to implant this under the skin.  The FDA would need to approve that, so the makers decided to just put it  on  the skin.  Spineless bastards.
