The idea that  urlLink Apple is moving toward x86 hardware  is old.  Most people do not realize that even if they did move toward x86, you would not be able to just grab a Mac OS X CD, format your Windows box, and install freely.  Parts of the x86 hardware are going to be proprietary, at least at first.  Specific hardware will be supported to get the x86 platform started, then full support may roll in if the idea takes off.
