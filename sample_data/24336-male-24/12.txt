Thanks to support from  urlLink Val , a Word of the Day will become more and more common here.  Today I have stolen the word from  urlLink Dictionary.com :ruminate \ROO-muh-nayt\, intransitive verb:1. To chew the cud; to chew again what has been slightly chewed and swallowed.2. To think again and again; to muse; to meditate; to ponder; to reflect. I definitely like the second definition better.
