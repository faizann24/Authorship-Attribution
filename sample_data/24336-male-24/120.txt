I never played the original Mechwarrior,  I loved the  urlLink sequel  and  urlLink expansion packs , then the  urlLink third installment  was marred by horrendous control.  Mechwarrior 4, though put out by M$, has some great  urlLink previews .  These  urlLink previews  show off the mechs of the series.  Way back in the day when I used to *cough*roleplay*cough*, we would mostly make our mechs/characters and that would be it.  Spend about 3 hours making the perfect character, flushing out all of the details, and never actually use them.  If I find my old folder of characters, I will scan some in just so you can all know how low I have been.
