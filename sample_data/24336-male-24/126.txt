I broke a heart today.   Well, it was more like I split a heart in two.  I got to bisect a sheep heart for the purposes of knowing where the major arteries connect to the heart.  The disection list has grown: frog, earthworm, crayfish, lamprey, mud puppy, shark, pig, cat, and now a sheep heart.  Yummy!
