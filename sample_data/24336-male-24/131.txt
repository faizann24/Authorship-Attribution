urlLink A day Without Weblogs ?  What a pathetic cause.  I can sort of understand a Day without Art (even though that is everyday in my life) supporting World Aids Day.  A day without weblogs is just another crappy webloggers movement.   Here are some great links on this day that I should not be linking (snicker):   urlLink ISketch  is a great form of online Pictionary.  It uses Shockwave, the interface is tight and the speed is excellent.  A great way to chat online as well! urlLink Schlong Song .  Sisqo likes meat.
