The AMD Duron processor (see  urlLink here ) got a  urlLink great writeup  at  urlLink Ars Technica .  I just wish I had enough money to keep up with computer technology.  I just finished building my latest computer 3 months ago and I am more than ready to upgrade.  Everything I have is at least one step away from top of the line.
