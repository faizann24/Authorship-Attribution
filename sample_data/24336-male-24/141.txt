*SPANKED*   That is all there is to it.  Java final: spank.  Anatomy lab practical final: spank.  Neither of those exams went well, to say the least.   To make matters worse, the exams were set back to back:  Java final from 6-8pm, Anatomy lab final from 8-9pm.  The fact that the exams were 2 miles apart also caused a problem.  Add in the "snow" factor, the "buses running late" factor, and the "my ride never showed up" factor, and you have a cold, late Mikey.  I got to the lab practical just in time to start, without instruction.  Luckily the lab format was "here is a hacked up animal-like thing; what is this inordinately small object inside the carcass?"  or "don't tell us what *that* object is, but tell us what it is related to in this other hacked up carcass".  Hey, all that matters is that I am done.
