My high school graduating class had about 450 students.  Within my high school was a smaller group, MSC (Math/Science/Computers).  This elite group of geeks had some serious issues (that could be a whole other site), but most of us had one thing in common.  Check out this  urlLink image .  This is the graduating class of MSC for 1998.  All of the people circled ended up going to  urlLink UMich  (or  urlLink U of M-D ).
