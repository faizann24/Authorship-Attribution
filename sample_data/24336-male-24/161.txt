If you are a UMich student, go check out  urlLink my.umich.edu , then bitch them out for not including a News service.   It's in the works, and  urlLink michigandaily.com  was redone with the idea of serving news to my.umich specifically.  I have been informed that the service will be up "some time soon", but that could be months from now.
