The weather must be getting better because I am getting back into computer games.  Why is it that I never want to play them in the winter, but only when the weather is great?!  Anyway, Jenn came over last night and I showed her the wonder that is  urlLink Quake III .  Maybe I did something good to my machine lately, but the game seemed to run much much smoother then the last time I played.  Also, I broke down and bought  urlLink Deus Ex .  It's a first person shooter that has a great storyline and incorporates cybernetics.  What more could I wish for?
