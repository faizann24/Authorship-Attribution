Well, another semester ends as does the era of another of my computers.  I have upgraded from an Asus P3V4X motherboard with 256 megs of PC133 ram and a 550MHz PIII (Overclocked to 623MHz).  The new system sports a Biostar (AKA cheap) motherboard with 256 megs of PC1600 DDR ram and a 900MHz Athlon (Overclocked to 1.017GHz).   My fastest Quake III demo numbers for the old system were around a max of 69.4 FPS.  The new system pulls around 106.9 FPS!   Nice.
