Update to the  urlLink previous post  (OpenBSD):   urlLink OpenBSD 2.9  has been released.  My server at home and all the servers at work are now using it.  So far, I haven't noticed much of a change.  I guess they were all working so well with 2.8 that they can't get much better!  Most people say that the greatest change is the use of soft updates in the FFS filesystem.  Nothing is terribly IO intensive on these servers, so no changes have been noticed...
