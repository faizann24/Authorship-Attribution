Update to the  urlLink previous post  (Java):  In the past 6 months I have flirted with  urlLink PHP ,  urlLink perl , and now  urlLink Java .   urlLink Michigandaily.com  is completely dependent on PHP, not only for displaying the pages but for creating the pages.  Using a cheap  urlLink iMac ,  urlLink perl , and a bunch of  urlLink OpenBSD  tricks, I created a backup server.  Good thing too, our web server died just two days ago!  As for Java, these skills are mostly for future consideration...
