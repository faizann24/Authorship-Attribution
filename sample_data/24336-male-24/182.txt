I have no shame.  A few days ago I was looking for emulators on the web.  Finding a free Gameboy emulator proved almost impossible but I found a  urlLink Java Gameboy emulator .  Other than the lack of sounds, it is quite amazing.  I started Java programming (Java, Java servlets, and JavaServer Pages) recently, and the code to the emulator is understandable and clean.  As with most applets, don't try to run it on a Mac; it crashed IE 5.  The next discovery was the No$ (no cash) emulator.  With a name like No$, I am thinking free.  Five minutes into playing  Pokemon , the game quits and the program pops up with "Pay us or you only get 5 minutes of playing at a time!!".  Bastards.  Didn't I say I had no shame?  Well, yes, the only reason I wanted these emulators was to play Pokemon!  And play Pokemon I have!  I have put over 8 hours into Pokemon Silver in the past three days.  Does that mean I found a free emulator?  No, but I found a way to circumvent the No$ 5 minute rule...   Want a copy?  Come and get  urlLink it .
