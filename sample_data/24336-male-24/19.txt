Windows Me (see  urlLink here  and  urlLink here )  urlLink might not be the last Win9x OS .  Tiger is the new code name, but it could become vaporware much like Cairo... but  urlLink The Register  also reports that  urlLink Cairo is being revived , but as a desktop explorer replacement.   Think  urlLink LiteStep , but with the same background code as the normal desktop.
