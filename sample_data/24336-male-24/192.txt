Throw 40 machines at a project, reap the results: I broke into the top 1000 on  urlLink Distributed.net .  That wasn't even using all of the machines at my disposal.  Lets see, what machines am I using?  i386  1.2GHz Athlon (Windows ME) 900MHz Athlon (OpenBSD 2.9)  (2 total)  800MHZ Duron (FreeBSD 4.3) 500MHz Pentium III (Windows 2000 Server) 366MHz Celeron (OpenBSD 2.9) 266MHz Pentium (OpenBSD 2.9) 200MHz Pentium (OpenBSD 2.9)  PPC  733 MHz G4 (Mac OS X Server 10.0.4) 533 MHz Dual G4 (Mac OS X Server 10.0.4) 500 MHz G4 (Mac OS 9.1)  (8 total)  400 MHz G3 (Mac OS 9.1)  (5 total)  266 MHz G3 (Mac OS 9.1)  (20 total)   That's 43 machines and 18.25GHz so far.  There are still 8 more iMacs (2.13GHz) that I am not using yet.  They won't help much, but it all adds up...
