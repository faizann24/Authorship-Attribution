D'oh!  I forgot that  urlLink distributed.net  usually has a few projects at a time and that you have to configure your client if you want to work on one specific project.  All of my clients (all 30 of them) are now working solely on RC5.  About 600 work hours were spent on  urlLink OGR , WTF that is...
