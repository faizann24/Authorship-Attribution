More exploits and fun.  DePaul university has not IP restricted their printers.  You can just ftp into any of these IPs and dump a print job: 140.192.11.10, 140.192.11.11, 140.192.11.14, 140.192.11.22, 140.192.11.24, 140.192.15.121, 140.192.15.122, 140.192.15.161, 140.192.15.245, 140.192.15.251, 140.192.16.16, 140.192.17.12, 140.192.18.121, 140.192.18.122, 140.192.18.123...  and the list goes on.
