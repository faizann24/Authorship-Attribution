Well, Sony dropped the price of the Playstation 2 to  urlLink $199 .  I still think that I got a great deal on my PS2:  PS2, 4 (four) (yes, four) controllers, memory card, and 10 games (Including Tekken Tag Tournament, Gran Turismo 3, Armored Core 2, Midnight Run, Madden 2001, NHL 2001, and Fantavision) for a whopping $225.  Beat that!
