So, today is Tuesday, which means that it is cool to like anything cool in the indie rock world.  Thus, I will add  urlLink  And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead  to my list of music to hunt down and devour.  It got a 10.  A fucking 10.  Pitchfork is usually full of shit, but a 10 is a commanding force.
