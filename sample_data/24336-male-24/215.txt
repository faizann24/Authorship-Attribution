My page is now HTML 4.01 Transitional and CSS compliant.  Does anyone still use Netscape 4.7?  I made some other changes to the layout, so it is very possible that the site is broken in NS 4.7.  The only machine I have that has NS 4.7 is my Sun box, but I can't seem to get DNS lookups to work properly...
