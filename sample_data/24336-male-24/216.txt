I only watched one show this year (other than SportsCenter, but all males watch that so it doesn't count),  urlLink 24 .  How, in the name of baby Jesus, did it  urlLink rank  below The Chair and just above Spin City?  Good thing there is going to be a second season.  If it got  urlLink deleted  like so many other shows this year, I would cry.
