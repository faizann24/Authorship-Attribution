Even better?       urlLink     Ok, I have ping-ponged between HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0 Strict about 4 times now.  Basically, I couldn't have the page be both valid XML and be parsed by PHP.  Well, just adding a  &lt;?php header("Content-type: text/xml"); ?&gt;  helped it get through the validator.  The page works in Mozilla, but IE 6 shows it as raw XML!  Forget it, I am going to stick with HTML.
