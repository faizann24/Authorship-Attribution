Perl is frustrating me.  Stupid websites are frustrating me.  Whenever a site doesn't include a feature I need, I usually end up including it for them.   urlLink OpenBSD.org  doesn't have a search engine, so I fired up  urlLink ht://Dig .  Now, a certain music review site lists old reviews alphabetically.  What a mess!  I am trying to use perl to spider through the entire site and dump most of the info to a database.  The main perl module for web data harvesting is  urlLink LWP , but it took me about 3 hours to get it installed.  It has 35,836 different dependencies and it just would NOT install on an OpenBSD 3.0 box through CPAN.  I finally got it to work using CPAN on a 3.1 box.  I should have tried the port first, but oh well.  More to come.
