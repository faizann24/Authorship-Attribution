Note to self:  stop linking to Pitchfork.  There is something about the singing of a soft, little girl voice that will transfix me on the spot.  It is vaguely reminescent of, what seems to be, a previous life.  I cannot explain what it does to me;  I feel at peace.  I can close my eyes and feel that I am floating through an opaque peach sky, weightless.   urlLink Saloon  is doing this to me right now.  Make it hurt.
