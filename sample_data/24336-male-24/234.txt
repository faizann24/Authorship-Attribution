I just renewed bibik.org at godaddy.com.  Why godaddy?  Register.com was charging $35/year, godaddy is charging $9/year.  The domain expires on the 17th, so here's to hoping that the transfer goes through in time.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be surprised if I have to find a new domain!  Bibik.org, bibik.net, bibik.com and bibik.biz (yeah, don't ask me) are all taken.  mikebibik isn't taken in any form, but I don't want anything so specific.
