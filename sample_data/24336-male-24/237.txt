I finally broke down and decided that my Ann Arbor apartment is just too hot.  When I brought a digital thermometer upstairs and registered  93.8  degrees, that's when I knew it was time to go back to Livonia for awhile.  Central AC is worth sacrificing my computer and my liberties, if for just a little while.
