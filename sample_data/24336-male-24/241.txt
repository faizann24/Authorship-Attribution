Since I started working a normal job (7 AM - 4 PM, Monday through Friday), I have been going to bed by 11 PM at the latest (yeah, soy un perdedor).  This morning was the second half of my A+ certification exam.  So, instead of studying last night, I went to the bar and drank 2 pints of  urlLink Bass  on an empty stomach.   I went to bed drunk around 12:30 AM, didn't study in the morning and still passed.   Ahh, the college life.
