If you don't know Linux, there are  urlLink many  great  urlLink places  on the  urlLink web  to get info.  Up to this point, all of the information I have come across has been helpful.  Today, I read  urlLink this article  about proxy servers, yet it is the most worthless article for anyone.  Beginners would be confused because the author does not explain how things are done, he simply gives a list of commands and what this setup  won't  do.  More advanced users would be better off reading the  urlLink how-to  the author had linked.  Make Linux easier for people to learn!  We must increase the strength of our attack!
