urlLink So true .  Ever since I started working 7AM - 4PM, my caffeine intake has doubled.  Mind you, it was horribly high before.  Now, I average about 72 ounces of pop (usually Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi) and 45 ounces of coffee.  That must be how I can type so fast.  I don't actually type, I just vibrate over the keyboard.
