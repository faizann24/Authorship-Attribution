So I finally moved out of 214 N Thayer, Penthouse C, last night.  I had to make three car loads back to my parents house in Livonia and one truck load to Matt's place in Ann Arbor for everything!  I will definitely need to sort through my crap and sell/give away some of it.  I was so worried about getting everything packed from my room that I missed a very important item I stashed downstairs:   my laptop!  Luckily, Matt grabbed it for me.
