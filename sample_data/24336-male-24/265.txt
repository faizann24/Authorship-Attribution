Here is a little perl script that I wrote for work over the past couple days.  Basically, our E10K (named CAD) had a hardware failure and the Oracle database struggled to come back up afterward.  The senior UNIX admin was having trouble getting a Korn shell script to correctly report whether or not a process was running.  Originally, this perl script would just grep the process list for one specific process and then shoot off an email to a list of admins.  Now, it will look for any number of processes and send emails to any number of specified admins.  The comments should explain it all.  The only line that might need some explanation is this one:  foreach $recipient_number (@{$process_recipient_bridge[$process]}) { process_recipient_bridge is an array of arrays (or list of lists, if you will).  I want to get access to one of those internal lists.  To get a single element in an array of arrays, you would use $array[index1][index2].  To get a whole array out, you still use $array[index1], but then you have to cast that as an array:  @{$array[index1]}.  If you want to run this on a BSD, OS X or Linux system, make sure that you change "ps -ef" to "ps -ax" and "mailx" to just "mail". #! /usr/bin/perl##---------------------------------------------------------##    CAD Process Alert Script                             ##    ------------------------                             ##                                                         ##  Usage:                                                 ##    Run as a cron job.
