Wow, I'll be damned.  You know how I said there were two main singers for that crappy opening band, Cuda?  Well, turns out, the guy with the better voice is Gar Wood from the Hot Snakes.  I just thought the regular bassist was taking some time off, so the guy from the Cudas joined them.  It's completely the other way around.  No wonder I was so confused, and no wonder there was such conflict, and no wonder his voice is that much better.
