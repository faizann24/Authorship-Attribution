Things are finally falling into place:  I have sucessfully signed up for electricity, cable, phone and DSL for my new apartment.  Ameritech, once again, is a bunch of asshats.  A simple activation took an hour longer than expected.  Let's hope their current special (DSL for $29.95/month, no install/activation fee) makes up for their asshattery.
