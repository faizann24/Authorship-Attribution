On top of still being very very  urlLink sick , I was woken up this morning at 5:45 AM with the most excruciating charley horse in my right leg.  It probably only lasted 15 seconds, but it felt more like a minute.  Here we are, seven hours later, and my leg is still in pain.  I need to reboot my body.
