A sinus infection has left me completely incapacitated.  I had to skip class yesterday, and I may do the same today.  I woke up this morning feeling like I had the worst hangover of my life.  My stomach hurt, my head was throbbing and my muscles were sore.  Yesterday, my nose was leaking like a burst water main.  It was quite odd, minding my own business, playing on the computer, then feeling a hot river of snot pour from my nose with undying fury.  The taste, that was what got to me the most.  Today, my combination of ibuprofen, asprin, claritin, generic over-the-counter decongestant and antihistamine and mulit-vitamins might keep this sickness in check
