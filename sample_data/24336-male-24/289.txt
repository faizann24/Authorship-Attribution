You know you are a software engineering geek when:    An every day problem comes along, and instead of just trying to solve it immediately, you have to plan for it.  "Well, we first have to figure out what the real problem is before we can solve it."  Then you have a requirements phase, trying to figure out what will need to be done to solve the problem.  Then you have a design phase, trying to come up with a good way to solve the problem.  Then you actually do it.  I need to spend more time with biology and less with computer science. It's pervasive.
