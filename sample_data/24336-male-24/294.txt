More important than a new laptop, I got to see Elaine last night!  She moved from Ann Arbor to Philadephia quite awhile ago, so it was great to see her.  She was having dinner with a bunch of her friends from her last job, working at a comic book store.  She was a bit concerned that I wouldn't fit in.  Me, not fit in?  I was just as geeky as the rest of them, it just didn't show as much...  Just kidding, they seemed like a great bunch of people.
