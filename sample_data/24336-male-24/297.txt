As I  urlLink mentioned previously , I signed up for  urlLink EMusic  recently.  In the first few days, I downloaded upwards of 1.8 GIG of music.  If they are going to offer unlimited downloads, I'm going to take advantage.  I've pulled down 49 albums so far.  Some of the highlights:  Adult. Apples In Stereo Belle And Sebastian Built To Spill Etta James Pavement Sahara Hotnights The Hives  More will be coming.  Maybe I should keep a list of all my MP3s since that list is growing so incredibly fast.  But anyway, for only $9.95/month (for 12 months) or $14.95/month (for 3 months),  urlLink EMusic  is a great deal if your tastes are broader than mainstream.
