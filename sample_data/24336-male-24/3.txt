To counteract my actions of snobbery, my monitor decided that it really really liked Yellow.  Trying to view the net in shades of yellow will kill your eyesight for at least an hour for every 5 minutes of surfing.  It was a nice flat screen 17 inch NEC, but I got it used without a warranty.  $350 will disappear from my wallet soon.  I am currently using a 14'' POS, and 14 inches is not enough to satisfy.
