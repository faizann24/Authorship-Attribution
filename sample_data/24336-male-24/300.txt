Just this morning I told myself that I would stop spending money.  In the past month, I've bought a new digital camera, work out shoes, a bunch of work out clothes, some regular clothes (but no more blue shirts because Leah says I have too many.  Not possible!), and a subscription to  urlLink EMusic .  I spent a lot of money going out, especially on food.  So, I said no more.  Then, I got a gift certificate in the mail for $15 at Express Men.  Jamie and I went today and I said I was only going to spend enough to use up the gift cert.  Not so much.  I ended up spending $80 there and then $40 at Fields buying some new cologne (Pleasures for Men).  I promise, no more.
