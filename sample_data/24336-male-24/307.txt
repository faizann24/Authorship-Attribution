Here is some background as to what has been going on in my life the past 5 months.  First, I am seeing someone new.  Her name is Leah and to try to explain how perfectly the relationship is developing would be to spoil it.  Expect to hear more about that later.  Second, and related to the first, I'm no longer with Laura.  Things were a bit rough at the end of last semester and she decided to end it.  No hard feelings, on my part.  Third, I will be graduating come April 25th.  Fourth, I have no idea where I will be after said graduation.  There is a job possibility down in Alpharetta, Georgia, but I won't be saying any more about that until I know for sure.
