Another good workout followed by consuming way too much damned food.  The last time I did this I ate a bowl of tomato rice soup, a ham and swiss on sourdough, a granola bar, a yogurt and two oranges.  Today was another bowl of tomato rice soup, a veggie burger,  urlLink three pieces of cheesy bread , two huge oranges and a bag of pretzels.  For lunch!  I am glad that my goal of working out is better physical fitness and health, not overall weight loss...
