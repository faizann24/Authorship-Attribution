This has been a crazy week.  The craziest part is trying to organize one of my interviews.  When they initially contacted me a couple of weeks ago, they asked for 8 possible interview dates.  I gave them 8 and then realized a few days later that one of those dates was the same as my AI final!  Murphy's Law in full effect, they chose that day.  I emailed my contact back immediately and asked if it could be rescheduled to any of the other days.  The best she could do was to push it back a day, to April 25th.  I have finals on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th and then commencement is on the 26th.  Bad timing, eh?  So, here is a rough estimation of my schedule for those three days:  April 24th   	10:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Final 	Between 3 PM and 6 PM: Fly out of DTW 	Between 6 PM and 9 PM: Arrive 	Afterward: Crash at hotel  April 25th  	6 AM: Wake up, get ready, find office 	8:30 AM: Interview, interview, interview 	Between 9 PM and Midnight: Fly out  April 26th  	Between 5 AM and 8 AM: Arrive at DTW 	9:15 AM: Commencement  I can't believe I am taking the redeye from an interview to catch commencement.
