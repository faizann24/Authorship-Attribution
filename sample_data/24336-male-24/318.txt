I *knew* I was using that word incorrectly.  Whenever I feel like I am giving up and letting someone else have their way, I might say something about " urlLink subjugating  my will" to them.  In all reality, I have been meaning to say  urlLink abdicate !  I could say something like "I'm just allowing you to subjugate my will", but that doesn't have the same ring to it.  Say it with me: "abdicate my will", "abdicate my will" and "abdicate my will".
