Over the years, a few people I have known personally have started weblogs.  Those are always the best because you know most of the basic information about their life anyway.  The weblog is just another glimpse into their psyche.  Well, just recently, Eric started his own  urlLink weblog .  Another one of my good friends started one as well, but that is NOT for public consumption.
