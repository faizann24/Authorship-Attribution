Last night, Joe and I had planned a little gathering.  It was going to start with pizza, then drinking/euchre/video games and then finally going to see the midnight showing of Batman at the State Theater.  Well, the plans quickly changed.  We started off playing spades, chowing down snacks and drinking beer.  Eventually more people showed up so we got pizza, played some GT3 and broke out the hard liquor.  When it was time to leave for the movie, we voted and decided it would be more fun to stick around.  This is when the night started to break down.  Somebody started getting pretty upset when we played Never Have I Ever, then another got upset because of sexual comments and then finally someone got violently ill.  There is still a huge mixing bowl filled with puke and a blanket covered in puke in our bathroom.  Other than that, it was great!  See the pictures  urlLink here .
