If you have a second, do a search for my last name in Kazaa.  Over 259 files showed up all because I embedded my name in the ID3 tag of some MP3s I ripped.  These songs were ripped my freshman year of college and then placed on my FTP server.  At the peak, this server got over 100,000 hits in a single weekend.  It's fun to see that my files have spread across the globe.
