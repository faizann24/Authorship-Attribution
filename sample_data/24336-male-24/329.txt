When I get older and I own a home, I will have a personal library.  I'm not talking about a den that has a large shelf of books.  I'm talking about a room devoted solely to housing books.  If my (or my wife's) affluence accounts for it, the books will all be bound in the same color and style (not necessarily leather).
