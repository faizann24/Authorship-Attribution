The future is closing in.  While I am reminded of Gattaca, there is a new patent out on  urlLink a machine that sucks up dead skin cells for analysis .  Since warm air rises, particles from the lower body are also circulating near the head.  Drugs, explosives, and other fun bits can be detected.  What gets me worried is that these skin cells can also be collected and then run through DNA analysis.
