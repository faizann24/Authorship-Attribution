The waters choppy, but it doesn't cut me, no 'Cause I ain't sinkin', no I ain't goin down below I don't think that way, you know I never have Well I cant slow down now just because you lag  You're always pulling, keep on trying to bring me down I'm going to show you that I don't like to fuck around You show your face and I'll look the other way You blink your eyes and you've got no friends to play  Pick up the slack I won't carry your monkey on my back Save the world Got no time, I've got to save myself today  I've got a mission to fulfill the things in life I've got a lot of things to see before I live to die All this negativity tries to bring me down As you get worse, I turn my life around   Death By Stereo - Looking Out For Number One
