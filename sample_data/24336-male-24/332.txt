Benadryl =  bad.    I've been taking Claritin for years now, at least since high school.  Just recently, they came out with an over-the-counter form of Claritin.  Now my health insurance doesn't cover perscriptions to Claritin and the OTC version costs $13 for ten doses!  When my prescription to Claritin had run out at school and I needed something to tide me over until I made it to the doctor next, I would just get an off-brand  urlLink antihistamine/decongestant .    When I went to the store to pick some up, they were all out so I decided to try the  urlLink Benadryl version .  Not at good call at all!  Some people take Benadryl just as a sleep aid and now I know why.  I took two in the past few days and my sleep needs have gone up at least 25%.  I even fell asleep in the car when Leah's mom was driving us back to Ann Arbor!  I had to take a nap from noon until 2 PM today even though I got more than my normal amount of sleep last night.  Does anyone need a sleep aid?  I'm not taking anymore of these.
