If the visitors of  urlLink Kempa.com  made up a list of best albums of all time, the concensus for the top spots would be: Radiohead - OK Computer : (9 votes) Weezer - Pinkerton : (7 votes) Beach Boys - Pet Sounds : (4 votes) Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime : (3 votes) Pavement - Slanted and Enchanted : (3 votes) Beatles - Abbey Road : (3 votes) Sloan - Twice Removed : (3 votes) Sadly, I do not have two of these albums (Abbey Road and Double Nickels On The Dime).  I should fix that soon.
