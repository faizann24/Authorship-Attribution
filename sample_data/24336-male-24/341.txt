I do realize that I will be graduating in three days, but I keep forgetting all of the little details that this entails.  Last week, I had my final class and final blue book exam.  This week, I wrote my final paper.  Tomorrow will be my final exam.  This is slightly overwhelming!  A lot of things are going to be different when I graduate.  There are many little advantages I take for granted, like student pricing on tickets and all of the computing access I get from the university.  I need to figure out what I'm going to do for a primary email address!  I will probably move over to something like mike@bibik.org soon.  But where should I host it?  I don't want to pay for hosting, I am leaving the Daily soon so I can't use their servers and my home server doesn't have a static IP.  Oh well, that might be the least of my worries.  More later, but for now, it's time for my second-to-last final!
