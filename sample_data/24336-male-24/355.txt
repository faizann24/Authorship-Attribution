Why does Treetop's Berry Juice contain pear juice, apple juice, grape juice and finally raspberry juice?  I mean, I guess it's  not  false advertising since they didn't call it Berries Juice; There is just a single berry.  When the front says "Berry from 4 fruit concentrates", I would imagine 4 berries concentrates, wouldn't you?
