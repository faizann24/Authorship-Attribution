It looks like the  urlLink second expansion for Neverwinter Nights  is going to finally resolve some serious issues with the game (especially issues Chris has with the game):  Lack of a kensei => New prestige class, weapon master Inability to see much of a playing field => Unlocked camera, meaning you can swing the view around to just about anywhere in the hemisphere above the floor around the character Boring henchmen => New scripting elements including romance Two character party maximum => Ability to bring along two henchmen
