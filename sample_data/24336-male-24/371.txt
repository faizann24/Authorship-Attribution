I'm a  urlLink healthy   urlLink motherfucker .  I stepped on the scale a couple of days ago and I'm now pushing 195 pounds.  I was 192 pounds last week so those three pounds are driving me nuts!  I'm working out a lot and definitely gaining muscle mass, but my fat levels are not decreasing.  I should add more cardio to my work out.
