The site seems to be operating at 100% efficiency again!  I'm not exactly sure what caused the slowdown, but my suggestion to my website admin is what caused the latest problems (eg  urlLink gallery  was broken)!  I noticed that the log files for apache were reaching sizes larger than 1.3  GB , so I suggested rotating the logs.  When apache was restarted, it was mistakenly restarted in chroot mode (a security feature that we don't really need) and that broke just about everything.  My  urlLink home dir website  was down,  urlLink gallery  was down, etc.  Another quick email and things are back up again!
