Damn you, AT&T Wireless.  So the new Smartphone is finally coming to market and it is being heavily marketed.  AWS is going to have a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal on launch day and everything.  The new phone is being sold for under $300, which is actually a great price point for the hardware and services being offered.  The device is being sold internally to Microsoft at a 45% discount, which is also amazing.  The problem is that AWS plans are so expensive!  Internally, the two plans being offered are $76/month and $95/month for 700 and 1,100 voice minutes respectively and 30 MB of data.  That is just WAY too much.  I thought spending $50 on my Sprint phone was overkill.  For unlimited data and 1,100 voice minutes, the price jumps to $109!  Come on.  Also, get this, those are the Microsoft discount rates!  For 1,100 minutes, it is normally $120 without data!  I feel like screaming.  No cellular service is worth that much.
