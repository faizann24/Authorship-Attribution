I enjoyed the first Max Payne enough to complete it twice (which is quite the rarity nowadays), so I've had some interest in  urlLink Max Payne 2 .  From the screenshots that were released early on in the development cycle, I wasn't too excited.  Now,  urlLink gameplay videos  are available and they have definitely changed my tune.  It's like they took all of the good aspects of the original game and improved upon them.  Bullet time looks cool and useful, unlike in the first game where it was a necessary evil.  Another thing I just noticed is that the object physics seem to be even better than the UT2K3 engine!
