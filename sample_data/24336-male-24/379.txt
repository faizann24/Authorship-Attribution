Someone recently asked me to suggest a digital camera to these specifications:  Small/compact Expandable memory (at least up to 512 MB) 3x optical zoom 4 megapixels My suggestion turned out to be for the  urlLink Canon PowerShot S400 .  After looking around for cameras, I realized that the S400 is smaller and has better resolution than my S30 and costs the same price new.  Silly technology improvements.  While whale watching, I encountered the only problem I have with my camera:  weak optical zoom.  Considering that the optical zoom on my S30 is only 3x and very few consumer-level digital cameras offer anything greater, I think I will have to stick with it for now.
