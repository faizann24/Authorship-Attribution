urlLink EMusic.com  is  urlLink changing drastically .  Gone are the days of 2000 downloads a month for $9.95 (well, $14.95/month for 3 months).  I  urlLink had a subscription  and I'm now glad that I cancelled it.  The new plan is $9.99/month for 40 downloads or $14.95/month for 65 downloads.  Given that Emusic.com mostly carries indie, most of my downloads were hit-or-miss.  I'd try something out just because they suggested it and sometimes it was great but more often it was deleted.  Now that the downloads are so restricted, usage patterns are going to be changed drastically as well.  The site should be euthanized.
