Wow, the Wings season begins  urlLink tonight !  Being out in WA now, I'm curious as to how many games I'm going to be able to catch.  Tonight's game is on ESPN2, but I have flag football practice at 6 PM and the game starts at 4:30 PM (PST).  I'm curious as to how the goalie situation is going to work out and how Hatcher is going to fit in with our team.  I doubt we are going to win the cup, but I'm still going to follow the Wings heavily.  Since Seattle and even WA doesn't have a hockey team, I'm completely allowed to root for the Wings!
