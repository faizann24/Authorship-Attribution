Ok, so in light of the  urlLink car rental fiasco , I decided to add car rental coverage to my insurance.  I got a bit curious as to what my insurance rates would have been had I purchased a different car.  I used Progressive's online quote service and got some interesting numbers.   Note, the quote I got for my car was $1,439 while in all reality I pay about half of that.  For comparison purposes, I'm going to take $700 from each of the numbers I got.  That should be more realistic:   2003 Ford Focus ZX3 2003 Ford Focus SVT 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sedan 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon 2004 Mazda RX-8 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 2003 Nissan 350z
