Deciding to change my own oil may have been a bad call and I haven't even done it yet!  After calling around to four different oil change shops in the area, I decided to do it myself.  The cheapest I found was $25 and that was at a place I wouldn't trust.  I ran to Napa auto parts and purchased six quarts of Mobil 1, oil filter, filter wrench, funnel, shop rags and wheel ramps.  $70 in initial costs and an estimate of about $31 per additional oil change means I'm going to spend more money to do it myself!  Granted, the prices that I was quoted for an oil change was not for synthetic oil.  I guess it is more respectable to change your own oil...   nah, I screwed up.
