urlLink Temple of VTEC Rumors and News - Honda HSC Concept foreshadows '05 NSX .  Comments later.  Update:  It looks like this is definitely going to be the prototype for the next NSX.  It's a shame that Honda is probably going to keep HP in the sub 400 range, and probably closer to 300 HP.  It coulda been a monster.
