My apartment complex is comprised of four seperate buildings that share a single underground parking garage.  When Russell and I moved in, we took two of the last parking spots available.  They were over by building B while we lived in building A but it is just a short 30 meter walk across the garage.  Last night after working out, I followed another car into the garage.  They parked over by building A while I parked by building B.  We crossed paths as we went to the opposing building.  I didn't think anything of it, but she called out to me just as I was about to enter the building.  We traded contact info and decided that we should trade parking spots.  She was quite attractive as well; maybe that is why I didn't say anything in the first place.
