urlLink BBC Top Gear : "I'm told that on a track, any track, the [Focus] RS is faster than a Subaru Impreza. Better looking too, but that's not hard."  Haha, I'm starting to agree with all the reports about the looks of the Impreza.  Sorry, Jeff and Joe, it really doesn't look all that hot.  Then again, I almost bought  urlLink this  and even I know it looks like crap.
