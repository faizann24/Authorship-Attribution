The  urlLink Honda Insight  is a gorgeous vehicle.  While the looks are very futuristic, the hybrid engine is utterly amazing.  70 mpg, 720 miles to a gas tank.   urlLink Auto.com  and  urlLink Car and Driver  have reviews, and everyone is in love.  At only $20,000, Honda is definitely selling this car at a loss.
