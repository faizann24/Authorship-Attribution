urlLink AutoWeek - Car News : "Mitsubishi trimmed 146 pounds of nonessential items from its already-stellar Lancer Evolution for even more performance. Those items include the wing; HID lights (replaced with halogens); rear wiper; air conditioning; ABS; power motors for the windows, doors, locks and side mirrors; the entire audio system; trim in the trunk; vanity mirrors; rear assist grips; map lights; lots of sound-deadening material and even that little piece of leather wrapping that goes around the parking brake lever."  All that removed and it's only $3,000 cheaper.  I'll pass.
