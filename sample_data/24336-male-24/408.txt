I need to cut caffeine again.  As stated in this  urlLink survey , my sleep requirements went from 8.5 to 5 hours when I quit caffeine.  I wasn't exactly sure if it was the lack of caffeine or the dramatic increase in exercise that was the cause of the change.  Now that I'm still working out just as much (or more) and I'm back on caffeine, my sleep requirements are back at 8.5 hours.  It wouldn't be such a bad thing if I wasn't falling asleep at inopportune moments...
