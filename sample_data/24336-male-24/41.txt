urlLink Tower Records has closed  their campus location in Ann Arbor.  Located in the heart of the Student Ghetto, Tower was a great place to hang out later at night.  Instead, the  urlLink U  is going to put the School of Public Health offices there.   There are plans to open up another Tower location, but closer to downtown.
