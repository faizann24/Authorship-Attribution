urlLink FCC allows home numbers to be switched to wireless phones - Nov. 11, 2003 :  When I first read this article, I thought "Great!  So many people will love this feature."  Now that I really think about it, how much use is this really going to get?  Ever since cell phones became popular, adding a new phone number became a routine occurance.  It is not that big of a deal to change a phone number.  I could have a skewed viewpoint because almost everyone that has my phone number also has an email address.  Everytime I changed phone numbers (which happened every year in college and once again when I moved out to Washington), I've sent out an email announcing the change.  It could be much more difficult for other people that do not have an alternate form of communication.   I can see this being used by people that ran a business line in their home.  They can keep the same number, which is probably on business cards, websites, etc but now have it tied to a mobile phone.  Since I work in the mobile phone industry, any way to get more people to switch is fine with me!  I do see one issue with this ruling though.  Up to this point, I believe that telemarketers relied on the fact that cell phones and landlines were completely seperate.  They knew which extensions mobile operators had and would not call those numbers (since it is illegal to telemarket to a cell phone since it costs the customer money).  Now, that line is completely removed.  Is there going to be a national database of cellular versus landlines?  How secure would that be?
