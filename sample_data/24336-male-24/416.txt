Just tonight, Jeff, Dan and I were discussing who are the worst drivers.  It may be stereotypical, but women are not as good of drivers on average as men.  Case in point, while waiting to turn left at a light, Jeff and I saw two cars pass that did not have their headlights on: both women, both on cell phones.
