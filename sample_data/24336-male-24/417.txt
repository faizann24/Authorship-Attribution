"A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's body, or even with a part of a woman's body and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia, too.  If he's honest, he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive." - Dostoyevsky,  The Brothers Karamazov
