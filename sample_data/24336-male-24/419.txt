Animals, animals and more animals.     Russell's older brother is currently studying to be a veterinarian.  Before we moved in together, Russ mentioned that he might want to get a dog eventually.  Back then, I stated that I wouldn't have any problem with that whatsoever as long as he was the one to take care of the dog.  I wouldn't mind having to ocassionally fill a food dish or take the pup out for a walk, but that would be about it.  The topic was dropped then, but Russ' brother recently had to spay/neuter a puppy for his studies.  Usually, these dogs are mutts from the Humane Society, but this one turned out to be a purebred doberman pinscher.  Since this dog was just so darned cute, Russ had to bring up the idea of getting a dog since his brother could give it away to anyone.  I said the same thing as before but pointed out that this dog wasn't going to be small for very long.  Also, he would probably destroy something if he was kept in the apartment by himself for 10+ hours a day.  We agreed, no puppy for us.  Kat and her parents have a total of three cats.  Two of them, Charlotte and Emily (the "Bronte Sisters") have been with the family for quite a few years now.  They are a mix between what seems to be to be a Russian Blue or Chartreux and an orange English Shorthair.  The third cat is Sebastian, a brown tabby, and is only 6 months old.  Emily is fairly social, so it wasn't much of a surprise when she felt comfortable enough to come up to me.  The other two are a different story.  Sebastian is still in the playful kitty phase, but Kat told me that I'm the only person other than herself that he has cuddled with. As for Charlotte, she isn't terribly social so Kat is also surprised when she always comes up to me for affection.  I think Kat is just jealous!  Kitties love me.
