My parents requested that I take pictures of my fully furnished apartment a few months ago.  I delayed because, well, the apartment still isn't fully furnished.  Additionally, the apartment is usually a complete mess.  Since I had today off, Russell was gone, all of my friends are out of town and Kat was busy until dinner time, I decided to clean the place from top to bottom.   urlLink Here  are those long-awaited pictures.
