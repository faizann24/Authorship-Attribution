urlLink Mitsubishi announces Lancer WRC04 :   After taking a year off from rallying, Mitsubishi has returned with a radical new vehicle to enter the '04 WRC season.  The overall body shape has remained similar to previous Mitsu WRC cars, but the underlying construction, components and technologies are radically different.  Personally, I am not a fan of the looks of the new car.  I can definitely see how it would be more aerodynamic than the last model, but they needed to make a few sacrifices in the visual appeal area.  There is another small picture of the design available on the  urlLink official WRC site .
