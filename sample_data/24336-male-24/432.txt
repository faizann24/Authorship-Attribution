Well I dragged Kat out to Greek food (Orexi) last night.  I think that was our last time!  Basically all of the food was overcooked.  She normally likes spanokopeta but not when it's that well-done!  My dolemades were fine but she didn't like those either.  Maybe we should stick to American and Italian.
