Only in Redmond, Washington are you going to find an Acura NSX:   urlLink      in the mall parking lot and a Ferrari 360 Modena:   urlLink      in your office garage.  I apologize about the quality of that second picture; I had to use the "Dim" mode on my camera phone and that cuts quality in half.  The NSX also had the license plate "SLOW V6", but my picture of that didn't come out.
