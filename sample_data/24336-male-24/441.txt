urlLink 	Ford strives to give SVT models upscale image :  Ok, so  urlLink we already knew  that Ford was going to drop the SVT Focus.  Now we find out that the Focus ST will not have the 170 HP engine from he UK but will be roughly 150 HP.  Not good.  To make up for that power gap, Ford will release a turbocharged Focus in 2005 or 2006.  The estimate is around 200 HP, so this will probably not be the 215 HP Focus RS, unfortunately.
