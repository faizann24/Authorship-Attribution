urlLink Not All Americans Are Stupid Quiz :   "You answered 20 questions correctly out of 20.  If you are American, the only way you got this score is by doing the quiz 50 times, and memorizing the correct answers. You need to approach the world in a less aggressively competitive way and learn to live with your inadequacies, rather than seeking to feel through bigotry and false national pride."   Well, it took me five times.
