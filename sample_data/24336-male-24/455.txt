Let's see, what's been going on lately...  Chris and Lindsay are getting married this fall.  Definitely congratulations to them!  I am the best man, so that means I should get started on writing the toast.  I've been best friends with Chris since 1992 and I've known Lindsay for years, so I will have lots of material with which to work.  My knee is slowly healing.  No longer do I need to wear my brace daily, just when exercising.  I no longer limp around and I have full range of motion.  I am supposed to go snowboarding this weekend, but that is not going to happen.  If I really want to heal on time, I need to do more physical therapy.  There is some political crap going on at work, but I can't say much yet.  I still have a job, so I am okay.
