So Kat spent the night last night because she had a big day today and her parents wouldn't leave her alone long enough to do her work.  She comes over here, and I set not one but two alarms so that she wouldn't be late for the big day.  Well, I set my bedside alarm clock for 6:30 PM instead of 6:30 AM and my PDA/phone didn't fire the alarm because the phone portion was off.  I'm really sorry.
