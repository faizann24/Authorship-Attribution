So I go to backup my MP3 drive on my server and it crashes, deleting every single MP3 I have collected for the past six years!  I am going to cry.  There was so much effort put into building that collection, from ripping my own CDs to downloading full albums from Kazaa to emusic (which isn't even the same site anymore).  So pissed.
