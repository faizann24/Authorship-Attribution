I should have posted this as soon as I woke up this morning, but I can never seem to get going until 1.5 hours after I wake up.  Unless I wake up late, I will kill 1.5 hours every morning.  Granted, I consider my drive to work to be killed time simply because I am nowhere near fully awake and thus I drive by instinct.  Listening to commercials the entire way there is not uncommon, simply because I am not paying attention whatsoever.  Anyway, the post.  The remembered dream from last night consisted of some sort of party.  It was possibly a party for me, or just a party in general.  I believe it was a party for me since I was given a car (an Audi TT, or at least the shell of one.   Someone said the rest would be in next week.  Odd choice of car since I do not and have never wanted a TT.) and there was an interesting gag gift.  Basically, someone took all of my prized possesions, which curiously included a house, shrunk them down and locked them in a glass case for everyone to look at.  All throughout the party I never noticed this case.  Once everyone had left, it finally revealed itself and of course I tried to pry it open to retreive my things!  It was a long case, probably 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and high.  The case was in segments, each with a sealed door.  After attempting to pry each door open, the last segment contained what looked like just a piece of yellow paper.  This door opened, and out flew a few miniature (fruit fly-sized) bees!  I'm not allergic nor phobic of bees, but I am not a fan.  For some reason, my mind told me that an ex-girlfriend, Emily, had done all of this.  Made no sense!
