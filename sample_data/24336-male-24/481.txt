I've spent so much time on this site now that I cannot remember where I came from to get to it (No, I can't just hit back in my browser since I open almost all new links as a tab in  urlLink Mozilla ), but it was probably  urlLink Slashdot .  Anyway, after having debated for a few years in high school, I learned a few terms for debate tactics, but here is an  urlLink entire site  with terms for each fallacy.  Honestly, I must have observed all of these at one time or another.  A few are extremely frustrating because it is almost as hard to explain the fallacy as it is to fight in the debate.  Some examples are  urlLink burden of proof ,  urlLink confusing cause and effect  (seems easy to explain, just try with some people!), and  urlLink straw man .  I will admit that I have used a handful of these fallacies as well, but I usually know I am using them.  They are only used when I do not have quite enough evidence to back up my clain so I attempt to hoodwink someone with a fallacy while I think of better evidence.  If someone catches me in the fallacy, now I can give an offical term for the fallacy to show that I genuinely knew what I was doing.
