urlLink KEXP 90.3 FM - where the music matters :   KEXP just played Hot Snakes.   Hot Snakes, on the radio.  Mmmm, if it wasn't for the fact that they play such a random playlist, I would love this station.  It's just too random, meaning there are a few songs I love mixed in with a bunch of stuff I've never heard.  I rarely like a song on one listen, so I rarely find anything new to like.
