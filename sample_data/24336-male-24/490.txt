urlLink AutoWeek - Car News :   Woohoo, even more Evo goodness!  This new model has just a few changes, but they are all improvements and the base price isn't dramatically increased ($32k for the highest-priced model).  The new color is dark gray, which is going to be the new hot color.   I'm sick of silver and its variants.
