urlLink Wired 12.03: The Complete Guide to Googlemania! :   My first thought, 13 pages all about Google!  This is great, mostly because Google is an interesting company to follow from a technological, political, economic and social aspect.  Second thought, crap, 13 pages I have to slog through with a bunch of drivel added since this is Wired.  Well, I read the whole thing, and it's at least worth a good skim.  I didn't learn much, but that's okay.
