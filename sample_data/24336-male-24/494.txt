How sad is it that my car is worth less than what I currently owe on it?   I mean, obviously that would be the case if I had just bought it or if I paid a very low down payment.   I put down $4k and the car is now 9 months old (and a 2003 model).  Gotta love almost 50% depreciation in less than a year.  Sigh.
