urlLink Rockstar Games Announces Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas :   Woohoo!  Having the next GTA set in San Andreas isn't shocking since the original GTA was in three cities:   Liberty City, Vice City and San Adreas.  I still remember the day that Chris brought over his copy of GTA:3 for Joe and I to try.  He had to take it away from us a few weeks later since he was going to re-gift it, but I went right out and bought another copy.  Joe eventually traded it in for GTA:Vice City but I was never as impressed with VC.  It just didn't have the same feeling since the character that you played actually had a voice and some emotion.  I much rather enjoyed the voiceless character in 3.  Thus, I bought another copy of 3!  I just need a PS2 to go with it now...
