So the first inline hockey game was yesterday!   Lee and I got there 1.5 hours early so that we could sign up for the league, meet the team and do a little bit of practicing.  The facility is fairly ghetto, located in what looks like an old warehouse.  It is seperated into a little practice field for soccer, the inline rink, then a larger soccer field.  The rink itself is in good condition with an interesting plastic flooring that reminds me of the plastic used for milk crates or toddlers blocks (not the shiny kind).    We only got about 20 minutes of practice in, but it was tiring.  I know that when I got off the rink at the start of the game, I was drenched in sweat.   We ended up losing 5-4, but I scored twice and Lee scored as well!  We both received praise during and after the game which made us both feel a bit better about playing.  Everyone seems very nice and laid back which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Our first practice is tomorrow (yes, we had a game before we practiced) so hopefully my sore knee and arm feel better!
