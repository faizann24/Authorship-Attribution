urlLink New Scientist : Does anyone else find it completely asinine that tobacco is the number one killer in the United States, accounting for 18.1% of all deaths in 2000?  Does anyone else find it completely asinine that obesity is about to overtake tobacco as the number one killer?   Also, 64% of Americans are overweight or obese.  Pathetic.  Ironic that I'm posting this to the web while sitting on my ass, but I'm not overweight, you pudgy MFs!
