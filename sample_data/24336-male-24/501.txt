urlLink New Scientist :  It looks like the "fact" that mammals do not produce new eggs after birth may be incorrect.  With a study done on mice, it appears that the number of living eggs decreases too rapidly for the number of eggs available at birth to persist until menopause.  To test if new eggs were created, an ovary from a normal mouse was inplanted into a mouse that was genetically modified to generate a glowing protein in all new cells.  After transplant, eggs were observed with the glowing protein, practically confirming that new eggs are created after birth.
