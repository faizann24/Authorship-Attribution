Ok, so my friend Alicia got hit on by a guy at a party last week, but they didn't exchange digits.  Instead, since this guy is a complete putz, asked a mutual friend for her AIM screenname!  She isn't going to date him, but they have talked a bit and she found out he has a vanity site:   urlLink Morris Singer .   Signs you are a PUTZ:  You place a picture of yourself in your title graphic. Your site is "Under Construction":  No one with a modicum of web design ability has used "Under Construction" on their site since 1995.  Go put your crap on GeoCities. You copy  urlLink all of your columns , and screw it up!  How many instances of "Restroom Revolution Gathers at Stonewall" are on that page?  Hard hitting journalism, at that! Your  urlLink photo galleries  are Javascript pop-up driven garbage. Your  urlLink bio  is written in third person perspective. You do not have a job or a degree yet you have a  urlLink business card . Your tagline is a warning:  "Thank you for visiting my site. Do not duplicate this information, content or design without written permission from me." Yeah, I know, someone could rip apart my site as well, but I can take it.
