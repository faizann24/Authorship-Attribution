I am genuinely curious to know, on average, how many people a person knows (basically friends and family) that have committed suicide?  Personally, I believe I only know of one person.  I say believe because I have a very good ability to block out many harmful events.  I only know of one person that committed suicide at my high school during the four years I was there and I didn't actually know the person, so they aren't on my list.  There was a discussion I saw online and some people knew upwards of nine people that had ended their lives.  I guess that high of a number just made me think.  I'm still thinking.
