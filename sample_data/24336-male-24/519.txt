The fourth FloorBurn game was last night.  We improved our record to 2-2!  Lee and I were back on a line again, but we just weren't in sync.  I was playing too far away from him and he wasn't able to get the puck up to me.  No matter what, I stole the puck deep in their end, deked the goalie and got my fourth goal of the season.  We ended up winning 4-1 and team morale was much higher than any other night.  It's possible that our practice last week really did help, but we shall see.
