I burned 9 CDs the other day, all for one friend.  It took about 6 hours, since I kept getting random errors during the testing phase. Eventually I figured out the problems, and wrote titles on all 9 CDs.  Turns out that the pen I used was so sharp that it tore the coating off the front of the CD.  The lasers used to read the CD shine right through, and they were all ruined.  Note to others:  only use paint pens to write on CD-Rs.
