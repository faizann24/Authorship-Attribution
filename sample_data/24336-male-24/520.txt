Ok, more updates to the use car hunt.  I totally forgot that Microsoft has its own classified ads!  I have contacted four more sellers and I already have two replies!  I cannot link to the cars since they are on an internal site, but I can tell you that one is a '92 Camaro and the other is an '83 Supra!  It would be cool to say that I owned a Supra, no matter what model year it is.  Both are in fairly decent shape, at least from what I was told.  The Supra needs a muffler, but that can't be more than $200 to replace.  I should be able to test drive both of them this week.  Maybe I will end up buying a car this week!
