I'm looking for a used car!  No, even with all of the problems with the Focus, (which I've since named Sanchez, since the car was made in Mexico and now I can make all sorts of "Dirty Sanchez" jokes) I am not thinking of replacing it for a used car.  I'm actually looking for an old manual car so that I can get better with an MT before I get a real car.  I figure, why not spend upwards of $2,000 on a used car, practice driving a manual, then sell it off for upwards of $1,500 rather than spending $1,200 on clutch replacement for a new car?  There is a parking lot a block away from my apartment where I can get a space for only $50/month.  I will put the least amount of insurance on it, so it shouldn't be too expensive of a proposition.  Here are the cars I've shown an interest in so far:   urlLink 1995 Saturn SL 2   urlLink 1989 Honda Civic   urlLink 1987 Honda Accord
