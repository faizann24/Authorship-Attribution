I purchased my  urlLink hockey skates  (image) last year when Eric and I decided to get back into inline hockey.  The wheels that the skates came with weren't bad (Labeda Shooters) and the bearings were satisfactory (ABEC 3 rated, the lowest rating but there are worse bearings out there that aren't even rated!).  I had used the wheels quite a bit playing outdoor inline, so they were quite worn down:    urlLink      The first two games of the indoor inline season were played on those wheels.  Needless to say, I fell a handful of times.  It took a few weeks of online bargain hunting, but finally I picked up a new set of wheels and bearings. Out with the old:    urlLink    urlLink      ...and in with the new:    urlLink    urlLink      Don't the new wheels just look so much better, especially on the blue chassis?    urlLink
