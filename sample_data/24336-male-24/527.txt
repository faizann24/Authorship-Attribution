I can't believe I forgot to post this!  So every three months, the  urlLink Puget Sound Blood Center  sends a Bloodmobile to my campus.  I made an appointment for the first time it came around, but had to cancel it due to a meeting conflict.  The second time it came around, I went to donate without an appointment and they were full.  Finally, I got to donate yesterday.  Since it was my first time donating with them, I had to go through the full screening process, mini interview and all.  Finally, I give blood and they have me lay down for an extra a few minutes afterward since this was my first time with them and all.  The actual process of giving blood went just fine.  As I was laying down resting, my stomach started to feel a bit nauseous.  Suddenly, the nausea got worse and I started to think about asking one of the nurses for something to vomit into.  The next thing I notice, there are three people crowded around me and I've got cold compresses on my neck and chest.  Turns out, I passed out!  I was only out for a few seconds, but it was not a pleasant experience.  Soon after I woke up, I broke out in a cold sweat.  I felt functional about 5 minutes later, but I was definitely tired and out of it for the rest of the day.  I, obviously, skipped my hockey game.
