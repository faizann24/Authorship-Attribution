Okay, okay.  At first, I wasn't going to post anything more about the Elise since it is simply not practical at all, it's $40k and all of the models allocated for this year are already sold out, but this  urlLink review  just takes the cake.  Such pithy quotes as "Its a prescription for disaster for those of us with acrylic nails." and "It will not disappoint its audience  'newly divorced men who are looking for a new wife,'".  I still want one, damnit.
