The more I read about the Pontiac Solstice, the more I like it.  Take  urlLink this article  from Autoweek.  They get to test drive a few engineering mules and were quite impressed.  If the car is impressive in 85% complete form and Lutz is driving this home as the most important GM project, the final result is going to be amazing.  UPDATE:  The car may only have 170 HP, but it also have 170 lb-ft in comparison to the 142 HP and 125 lb-ft found in a base Miata.   Even the new Mazdaspeed version only has 178 hp and 166 lb-ft.
