Gah, I can't believe I forgot to post this earlier!  So, on Monday, I had a cashier ask me about my age.  Well, it happened again on Thursday!  I was going to Sports Authority to buy an ankle brace for Kat when it happened.  I picked out the brace and headed to the first available cashier.  I paid with a credit card and had to use one of the electronic signature readers.  She told me to keep my card out for signature validation so I also pulled out my drivers license.  My signature never looks right on this electronic devices so I did it just in case.  I guess the cashier looked at my birthdate because when she handed my cards back to me:  "Are you 23, 24?" "23, why, do I seem older, younger?" "More mature." "Any reason?" I'm 21 and guys our age seem younger.  You dress well, like you made it somewhere, you seem established."  The funny thing is, I was wearing a long-sleeve jersey material shirt (Kenneth Cole, but she couldn't tell that), Gap slacks and black Puma sneakers!  I definitely wasn't sporting "mature" looking attire.  Oh well.
