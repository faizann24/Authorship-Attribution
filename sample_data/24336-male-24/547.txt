My brain is triggered to wake up if I hear a diesel engine idling outside of my window.  Why?  Well, back in senior year, I was sharing a parking permit with a roommate.  I was almost towed twice for parking in my apartment lot without the permit but I heard the idling tow truck and woke up!  Anyway, there was a truck idling outside of my apartment this morning around 7 AM and thus I woke up.
