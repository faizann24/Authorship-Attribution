urlLink What was Number 1 on the day you were born???? :  I remember seeing this site years ago but I don't think I ever blogged it.  Here are some songs: Mine:   Magic  by Olivia Newton-John Kat's:  Pop Muzik  by M Jenn's:  Funkytown  by Lipps, Inc.   (bwahahaha)  Just for kicks, the song 9 months before my birthdate was  No More Tears (Enough is Enough)  by Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer.  Hmm, not sure what to make of that one.
