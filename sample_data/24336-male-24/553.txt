Oh, BTW, my gallery is hosed.  I'm not exactly sure when it happened or what happened, but it's hosed.  I tried to upload some pictures last night and my upload tool kept crashing.  I tried to add the pictures through the normal web interface and that was having some problems.  When I couldn't delete some albums, that's when I knew it was completely messed up.  Even upgrading over the existing installation didn't help.  Looks like I get to rebuild it from scratch this weekend!  Yay!
