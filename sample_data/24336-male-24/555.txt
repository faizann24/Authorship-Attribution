Hmm, power to weight ratios, one of the most important aspects of any car.  The Focus only has 130 HP but it only weighs 2551 pounds and has 135 ft-lbs.  The Camaro, on the other hand has only 140 HP and weighs 3103 pounds but has 180 ft-lbs.  A few calculations later give 19.62 pounds-per-HP and 18.90 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Focus and 22.16 pounds-per-HP and 17.24 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Camaro.  The Focus is faster than the Camaro but the Camaro has better low-end acceleration?  Weird.
