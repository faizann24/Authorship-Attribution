Now that Russell is moving out and I do not have a roommate yet, my rent goes from $672.50 a month to $1570 a month!  I get to pay $95 a month for the right to a second parking space when I do find a roommate.  I also get the fun of trying to find said roommate which is becoming harder than I expected.  Thanks!
