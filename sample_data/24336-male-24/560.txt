Well, my gallery is officially dead.  I'm in the process of rebuilding it.  Anyway...  Religion is just a meme in the minds of many.  The mind is comprised of a collection of neurons with some capabiilty of memory and higher processing.  The neurons are a physical entity that is controlled by chemicals and electrical pulses.  Viruses can have an affect on chemicals and chemical processes.  Why can't someone just create a virus to destroy religion?  Would it really be that hard?  Please?
