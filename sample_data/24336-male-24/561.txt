As a kid, I absolutely hated a warm pillow.  I would have difficulty falling asleep because by the time I had rested enough to almost fall asleep, the heat of my pillow would annoy me and wake me up.  I would either flip the pillow or sleep on the other end.  In other words, the average pillow had four sectors.  By the time I was done with all four, the original sector had probably cooled down to normal and I could switch to it.  I remember being awake for at least an extra hour some nights because of this.  I no longer have this problem, otherwise I would run out and buy the  urlLink Chillow !  A small, flat but otherwise pillow-shaped insert, the Chillow acts as a heatsink and radiator.  It makes one side cold and one side a bit warm.  The warmth is absorbed by the pillow proper and dissipated leaving the surface nice and chilly.  Hell, I might buy one anyway!
