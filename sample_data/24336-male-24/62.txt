The problems setting up the  urlLink OpenBSD  server continue.  In an attempt to make use of old hardware, I tried to use a Pentium 60 machine.  It was the very first real computer I ever used.  The Bios came out when the idea of "Plug and Play" did not exist. All of the network cards I have are PnP.  There is a way to configure them manually, but that would require installing them into my current machine (which can definitely handle PnP), booting from a DOS disk, then running a few utilities.  Instead, I will probably just use my old K6 233 machine.  In contrast, once I get the hardware setup, I will have almost no trouble  urlLink configuring OpenBSD 2.7 as a cable NAT system .
