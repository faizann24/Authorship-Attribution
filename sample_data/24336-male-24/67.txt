my.umich.edu (no link since the site isn't up) is a new portal being developed for the staff and students of The University of Michigan.  The  urlLink static gateway   that is currently in use has proved to be all but worthless, mostly because searching of lower pages in the hierarchy is chaotic.  A  urlLink preview  shows just how ugly the new site is going to be.  Also, one of the press releases talked about how headlines will be pulled directly from  urlLink The Michigan Daily website .  As the Systems Administrator, I can say that I just installed the new web server and it is not ready!  The  urlLink main online developer  has yet to configure the web server, mostly because we just installed the hardware late last week.  The site is being fully redesigned, and we are all quite excited.  Hopefully we can help with the headlines on my.umich.edu, in a couple months  .
