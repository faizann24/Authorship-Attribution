I used to joke about how my main non-free ISP was AOL (simply because a family member has paid for it, and I get an account), yet my main operating system has become some flavor of UNIX.  I thought I would never see this day, but there is now an  urlLink AOL client for Linux .  I cannot try it out, simply because I only have a winmodem that doesn't work in Linux, but we shall see when I get that cable modem...
