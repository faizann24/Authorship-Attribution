Don't laugh.  It feels weird that I no longer have an  urlLink AOL  account.  Even though I have had much better ways to connect over the past two years (think LAN connected to a T1), the lack of the ability to hop on AOL is overwhelming.  No longer can I check the profiles of friends, no longer can I...    wait, I guess all I ever used AOL for was to check profiles.  I just need to 'borrow' an account from someone every once in awhile, and all will be good.
