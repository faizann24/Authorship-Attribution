I remember discussing the futility of regrowing neurons in my Neurobiology class first semester of my sophomore year.  It was decided that even if new cells could be transplanted and they would grow, the neural net would be so complex that the cells would never fully integrate themselves.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania has made an attempt at this experiment.  The  urlLink results  show that the neurons helped stroke victims regain motor control.  A very promising step indeed.
