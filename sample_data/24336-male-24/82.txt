Linking up an  urlLink iMac  to an  urlLink  OpenBSD  box to a  urlLink Windows 2000  box to a  urlLink Windows Millenium Edition  box is a lot harder than I thought.  I have failed at getting either  urlLink Samba  or  urlLink netatalk  to work on the unix box.  Both will compile, but both have serious problems when launched.  There was even difficulty sharing between the Windows ME and Windows 2000 boxes!  I forgot that I disabled Guest access on the W2K machine, and that prevented the WinME machine from connecting.  Grr
