How random!   urlLink Modern Humorist  is a fairly funny site which I have only just discovered.  Just like  urlLink The Onion  did awhile back, they have  urlLink mentioned my hometown of Livonia, Michigan .  It's buried near the bottom, so keep reading.  That place is a strip mall of 100,000 people, 98% of which are white.  The city is not worthy of mention.
