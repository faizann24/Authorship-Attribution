A giant development in the world of cybernetics has occured.  The  urlLink first true cyborg  has been created.  Based on a  urlLink wheeled robot design  (looks like a robobiscuit), but controlled by a few neurons from an eel, the cyborg can follow or flee light and move in a circle.  This does not seem like much, but the implications are astounding.
