What the hell?  My keyboard just died.  I thought maybe it was the AT --> PS/2 converter I was using, but a replacement did not improve the situation.  Then I thought maybe it was the port on my motherboard.  I found a PS/2 -- > USB converter and tried that.  I 'borrowed' a roommate's keyboard, and that worked just fine.  Feeling quite pissed off (do you have any idea how hard it is to use a computer without a keyboard?), I took the old keyboard and shook it around a bit.  The power of fear made it work again.  Now I can get back to my regular life.
