This makes me oddly depressed.  The mere idea that the  urlLink X-33 will not fly  is troubling.  Mostly, because of the Mars Lander fiasco, NASA is not seen in the brightest of lights anymore.  The delays in developing the X-33 are mostly safety based (which makes sense if anyone remembers a  urlLink slight problem  in 1986 with the Challenger...), but these delays are not giving NASA credibility.  They need one project to work, and to work  well .  The International Space Station is still in development, and can't save them yet...
