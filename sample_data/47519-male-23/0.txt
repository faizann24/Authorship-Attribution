You are the flame in my heart You light my way in the dark You are the ultimate star You lift me up from above Your unconditional love takes me to paradise  I belong to you And you You belong to me too You make my life complete You make me feel so sweet  Your soul and mind are entwined Before you I was blind But since I've opened my eyes And with you there's no disguise So I could open up my mind I always loved you from the start But I could not figure out That I had to do it everyday So I put away the fight Now I'm gonna live my life  Giving you the most in every way  I belong to you And you You belong to me too You make my life complete You make me feel so sweet
