Look at the stars, Look how they shine for you, And everything you do, Yeah, they were all yellow.  I came along, I wrote a song for you, And all the things you do, And it was called "Yellow."  So then I took my turn, Oh what a thing to have done, And it was all "Yellow."  Your skin Oh yeah, your skin and bones, Turn into something beautiful, You know, you know I love you so, You know I love you so much.   I swam across, I jumped across for you, Oh what a thing to do. Cos you were all "Yellow,"  I drew a line, I drew a line for you, Oh what a thing to do, And it was all "Yellow."  Your skin, Oh yeah your skin and bones, Turn into something beautiful, And you know For you, I'd bleed myself dry For you, I'd bleed myself dry.  It's true, look how they shine for you,  Look at the stars, Look how they shine for you, And all the things that you do.
