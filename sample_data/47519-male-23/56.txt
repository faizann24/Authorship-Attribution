Take my hand You know I'll be there, If you can I'll cross The sky for you love. For I have promised, oh To be with you tonight And for the time that will come.  Take my hand You know I'll be there, If you can I'll cross The sky for your love. And I understand These winds and tides, This change of times Won't drag you away. Hold on, hold on tightly, Hold on and don't let go Of my love.  The storms will pass It won't be long now. The storms will pass But my love lasts forever.  And take my hand, You know I'll be there, If you can I'll cross the sky For your love. Give you what I hold dear, Hold on, hold on tightly. Hold on, hold on tightly. Rise up, rise up with wings, Like eagles you'll run, you'll run You'll run and not grow weary.  Take my hand, take my hand. Hold on, hold on tightly. Hold on, hold on tightly. This love lasts forever, This love lasts forever, Take my hand, Take my hand.   U2 - Drowning Man
