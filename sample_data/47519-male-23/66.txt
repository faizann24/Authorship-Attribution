A thousand years, a thousand more,  A thousand times a million doors to eternity  I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times An endless turning stairway climbs  To a tower of souls  If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,  The towers rise to numberless floors in space I could shed another million tears, a million breaths, A million names but only one truth to face  A million roads, a million fears A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty  I could speak a million lies, a million songs, A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time But if there was a single truth, a single light A single thought, a singular touch of grace Then following this single point , this single flame, The single haunted memory of your face   I still love you  I still want you A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  Like galaxies in my head  I may be numberless, I may be innocent  I may know many things, I may be ignorant  Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands  I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times  Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes  Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief  I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief  I still love you  I still want you A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  Like galaxies in my head On and on the mysteries unwind themselves  Eternities still unsaid   'Til you love me   Sting - A Thousand Years
