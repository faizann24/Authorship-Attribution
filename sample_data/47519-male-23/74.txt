In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape. Broken branches trip me as I speak. Just 'cause you feel it doesnt mean it's there. Just 'cause you feel it doesnt mean it's there.  There's always a siren Singing you to shipwreck. (Don't reach out, don't reach out) Steer away from these rocks  We'd be a walking disaster. (Don't reach out, don't reach out)  Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there. (There's someone on your shoulder) Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there. (There's someone on your shoulder)  There there  Why so green and lonely? Heaven sent you to me.  We are accidents Waiting waiting to happen.  We are accidents Waiting waiting to happen.
