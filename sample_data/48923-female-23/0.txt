This blog is dedicated to Leigha Horton, an actress in the Twin Cities metro area. It's for Leigha sightings, Leigha news, Leigha reviews, and Leigha gossip. It is also for Leigha squeeing.  It is run by two fangirls who think Leigha Horton is the best thing since sliced bread. She's just that great. We're both straight and in relationships (one married, one long-term), so it's not some creepy sexual thing (though Leigha is hot!). We're also not stalking her, at least not in a bad way (we do enjoy knowing all we can about her, though).  All great performers need fans, and we are some of Leigha's.
