Leigha performed at  urlLink NARAL: Pro-Choice Minnesota's  5th Annual  urlLink Comedy for Choice .  Leigha was, of course, brilliant and funny and the best performer behind the genius  urlLink Kevin Kling  (but he's awfully hard to beat, even for someone as great as Leigha).   And  she's pro-choice.  What a woman!
