somehow, life seems more profound when you're using your thumb (and the wonders of t-9) to make a limited string of characters post.  somehow they seem cringe-worthy the day after.   is it the memories of all of the angry fliers because their flight was cancelled?  or was it because i almost missed my flight because  they couldn't figure out how to open the airplane's door . stale hot air plus agitated people who have stood up only to be crammed into the aisleways of an already late flight like sardines waiting for the door to open.  they had to send in the technical support people, thus it took 20 minutes until the door was openable.  all the while, over the intercom we're reassured that the door will be opened any minute now.
