why must you apply cheesy thunderstorm sound effects to your watering cycle?  -- confused shopper   i've heard that at certain grocery stores, people aren't just shopping for groceries...   but besides some strange words exchanged to me in the freezer aisle once, no stranger has ever hit on me whilst grocery shopping.  this is most likely due to the fact that i rarely shop alone, and i rarely shop at a place where people speak english as their native language.  now i have been officially hit upon in the grocery store, and i don't know if i should be disturbed or flattered.  it happened in the organic section.  i was contemplating how "eating well" is actually related to having wealth, as i was eyeing a display of expensive but possibly tasty organic produce.  (i actually dream of the time when i can afford to eat only organic foods, and will have wonderfully sharp chopping knives.  this most likely won't happen anytime in the near future.)  and here comes this person who starts chatting me up, and broke my organic thought process.  i would rate this attempt to hit on me rather low.  it was too cheesy, but not clever or funny.  (i could've fallen for a "Hey, you dropped your name tag" and then being handed a packet of sugar.)  and then the individual seemed hurt that i started walking away towards the conventional produce without offering my name, my number, or the likelyhood of sex.
