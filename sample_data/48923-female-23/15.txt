my immediate family rarely, if ever, sees my exponentially large extended catholic family. which makes us the black sheep of the family because everyone else's kids are best buddies,  belong to the same churches, or spend large quantities of time on the phone with each other. we also are the only ones who are not local, and are the ones closer in age to our aunties than our rapidly multiplying mass of cousins.  this is why it is completely surprising that one of my 5 year old cousins was more excited to see My Dad than to receive gifts from santa claus.  what five year old is more excited about seeing a person, than getting stuff?  there are a few things in this world that i don't understand, this being one of them.  i have reasons to suspect that my dad's brainwashing of my cousin's mom (aka my dad's sister) left a mark in her genes.   this aunt is otherwise known as the aunt my dad convinced light is actually dark (at times we'll point to light bulbs, say "Daaarkkk" and giggle in her presence.) which might've been due to my aunt being born 17 years after my dad.  she adores my dad.  now my cousin was often found drapped across my dad and at times drapped across my dad's kids due to association, in an almost minor-deity sort of way. she would bat her eyelashes and sweetly sing my dad's name. strange behavior for a kid who prolly hasn't even seen her uncle/my father in a year.
