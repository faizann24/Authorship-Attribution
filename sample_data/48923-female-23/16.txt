(otherwise known as the ponderings as why the hell i'm not sleepy yet.)  recently i've transversed 5 time zones whilst trapped in an airplane's window seat.  although, i managed to get in a good four hours of sleep (on an airplane, which usually counts as negative sleep) i haven't been able to reaquaint my sleep cycle with my native time zone.  it is well past my usual bedtime, and i haven't even been able to fake a yawn. and i've tried.  boring reading materials, jammies, warmth, darkness, and the hour of the night have no jurisdiction over my body's relative sleepiness.  to the point that i wonder if i was fed radio active airplane food which has mutated me into a human who needs no sleep, even though i crave a good night's rest.  perhaps all will be better when i end up being trapped on another airplane's window seat, going backwards 3 time zones.  this is what i hope, whilst i ponder more ways to force sleepiness.
