dear readers,  i have adopted a cat, and have been struck by lack-of-name-itis.   do you have any suggestions?  here is a bit about him:  he's a purr machine.  purring and rubbing against people seems to be his speciality.  he's mostly black, with a white belly (he loves belly rubbing) and white slippers.  he already owns my apartment.  he's terrified by bubbles.  absolutely terrified.  he can leap over large hurdles whilst fleeing the catnip bubbles.  even if he's taking a nap, if someone leaves the room that he's in..  he'll rouse and chase after them.  he's 2-3 years old.  he was found on the 14 of feb, and taken home on the leap year.
