there is a certain image i get in my head, when one says we're going to go look at art galleries.  to me this definition includes some of the following:  a ground floor room on a commercial street front.  darkness and almost a feeling of claustrophobia.  the possibility of buying things.  a person who is present, and might be the artist, but they really want to make a sale.  instead my first gallery crawl in chelsea, in the city of verticality, completely fucked with my version of an art gallery. first off, these places have a thing for elaborate "art" doors.  which was was the beginning of the fodder for snarkiness with others.   are they going for the industrial look, or the frosted glass and private appeal?  how does the handle cause investors to blow a money load? secondly, they always seem to have a person working at a desk near the front door.   this person will never make eye contact with you. thirdly, despite being in one of the most expensive cities in the world, these galleries are spacious if not empty.  which somehow ooozes, "yes my scrawling on a piece of paper will bring in at least 5 figures,"  just look at all of the empty manhattan wall space around me. fourthly, it is not the trend to leave a title of your work on the wall near your art, or even your name.  because the people seeing your art, just know. fifthly, there are only art galleries in chelsea. a sprinkling of boutiques or eateries, does not exist.  commerce does not exist. everything is a gallery.  there a buildings with galleries on every floor.  to the point that i seriously don't understand why there are all of the galleries in the first place (they don't make money off of the common plebians who might wander into their gallery as there is barely anything to show, and they have nothing for the plebs to buy.)  the art world baffles me.
