it has recently been rediscovered that i  loathe  potatoes.  see, i've never really liked americana fare (french fries, hamburgers, potato chips), but i had myself convinced for awhile that i really enjoyed something which contained potato byproducts.  convinced until one day, i realized i couldn't spit said item out of my mouth fast enough, for i had realized the potatoey-ness lurking inside.   that gritty starchy taste that really makes me wonder how half of the family tree survived eating the damn things, when i can barely stomach the idea of the things.
