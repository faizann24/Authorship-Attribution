!!!!tmi warning!!!!    Usually Miss P's entrance is dainty and slightly tardy.  her tardiness, i suspect is somehow related to my own complete lack of speed in matters such as leaving the house (a field in which i'm notoriously slow, and i'm not a person who "applies her face" everyday, i'm just not entirely motivated to leave bed-dress- feed myself- and locate the things i need for the day), her tardiness is completely welcomed.    Her daintiness usually only lasts a day, which she pulls a Mr Hyde and goes into a rage of turning toilet water pink (which amuses me so), turning turning other things red (which doesn't amuse me, as i hate doing laundry), and turning me into a crampy angry person (which never amuses those around me).  Yet this morning, her entrance was far from dainty as it was more of an explosion.  I'm talking about an explosion near the size of the collapse of the twin towers, the type of explosion that covers an entire metro area and they're entirely confused about what hit them.   I almost want to watch the news just for the leading headline of, "menstrual blood  bomb coats entire city, police mortified."   Hell, I'm afraid that if someone came into my apartment, they'd wonder where i stashed the body.  I honestly wonder if she's trying to kill me on this visit.  And I'm currently unsure if she's conspiring with my current illness, to make me one large wanting-to-slit-my-wrists body of pain.   !!!!end of the tmi!!!!
