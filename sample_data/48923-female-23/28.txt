is it possible that the people downstairs have been invaded by a different (loud) life form?   the people who live directly under my apartment (duma) are a rather quite bunch, quite unlike the elderly couple in the apartment across the hall from them whose fights are louder that i'd ever image coming from people of their age.  the duma's are a married couple with a young child, are from some country i couldn't place on the map, and are quiet....  or at least were quiet.  is it possible that the insilation melted away and that they were always this loud?  or have they been replaced by simlar looking inviduals who are quite the party animals?  whatever happened, i'm having a harder-than-usual time at actually concentrating on my homework.  to the point that i haven't even started on the stuff that's due tomorrow.
