imagine me, waiting outside of class in the hallway... reading a graphic novel on a couch.  no, not a  porno graphic novel, a  graphic novel is just the "adult" name for a comic book for those of you out in teeveeland.  intro: random stranger who is reading over my shoulder.   the random stranger who i will be seeing gyrating completely nude in a a few minutes.  which i didn't know at the time, but in a department where i at least recognize all of the students and i didn't recognize him (and i knew there was going to be a nude model)...    i show him the book...  and thus the hitting on begins.  every little break from drawing, he has to run up to me and talk.    and i being the stupidly nice person i am, i give him a granola bar (i always have a granola bar to give to street people asking for money for food.  but they never take the granola bar) because he asked about nearby vending machines, and the closest food would require going outside and most likely not be the place one wears a bathrobe.  thankfully, he was shooed out the door after we were done drawing him and gearing up for critique time, right as he was attempting to get my digits...
