i will be getting a cat for my anniversary. (somehow i find is strange that my friend who has been with her guy for one day longer than i've been with mine, is already married with a child and a cat.... and i'm only now possibly getting around to having a cat.  it's like that day difference is several decades...)   this weekend we visited the pound, my first trip ever to a pound.   and there is something about the smell of the decaying animal food and excrement plus the constant yelps of dogs who fear the chamber, that makes me want to adopt every kitty i see.  or at least, if i can't adopt them all, it makes me want to free them from their cages and just have a good little play time.
