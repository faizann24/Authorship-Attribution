side side side thought: there are certain phrases that in my mind have a significance which only a few other people might catch.  we're about to come up to one of those  it has been decided  still makes me burst into giggles,  should i post a backstory?  anyway, back to this post  that i am to become a stereotypical embittered graduate student who drinks lots of coffee, perhaps i could even find some blazers with elbow patches for added ambiance (but i won't be picking up cigarettes for kicks).  maybe i could also flaunt my ability to wear all black for many days in a row, just because that's all that's left in semi-clean laundry land.  last week, graduate school began in full force with kicking me in the ass.   last week, i was near slitting my wrists in the misery in ways that only graduates students might know.  see, last week, i started the lack of sleep program and i didn't pick up any of my newly acquired love....  coffee.  on the whole, i'm not particularly found of coffee.  in delis in new york (and essentially everywhere in the world) it tastes horrible.  there is that overriding bitterness which can only be doused away with insane amounts of sugar.   it isn't supposed to be bitter (ah, those years working at a coffee shop) but the world sucks at brewing the stuff and the stuff they brew just plain sucks.  but you reach this point when you don't care, and all you do care about is the ability to stay awake thru classes and to actually function mentally.  hi, i'm now a little ray of sunshine happiness due to coffee.  i might even break out into song about how i love coffee, and how i love the fact that i've only had 3 large cups today.   happy, happy, happy.  oh, i love coffee.  (holy hell.  i wonder if this qualifies for my most ADhD post ever.  but seriously, coffee! coffee! coffee!!!!!!!!!!!   i need to invest in a coffee maker, stat.)
