minor experiement du'jour : depending upon what a child is shown will affect what they produce.  the topic of the class (for two different classes of 2nd graders)  was squares, circles, and lines.   the kids were supposed to draw something on the computer involving squares, circles, and lines, and then write about the number of S C & L they used and what they drew.  with one class, they weren't given an example..  and what they drew completely varied from flowers and trees to trucks and towers.     but the other class was shown an example of how to use S C & L to make something, the example being a truck.   even though the image of the truck was on the screen for a short while, nearly all of the kids in this class drew a truck exactly like the example truck, including the same color scheme.   i've noticed this phenomenon before, when kids were picking out online pictures to use for stories.   if the example was one, they'd all go for the same picture...  if there wasn't a picture shown, they would all do something different.   i wonder what the connection between creativity and the inspiration for creativity,  just as i'm working on a homework project and am almost unable to think of something outside of the teacher's example.    is the authority of the teacher, something that replaces creative thought whatsoever?
