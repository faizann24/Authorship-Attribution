i love being able to file my taxes online, and have some computer try to figure out all of the numbers for me.  (have i ever told you how horrible i am at mental math and simple math?  and it's not because i'm a girl and "math is hard,"  sometimes i wonder what would've happened if i pursued a math major... )  but, i've caused an error on my taxes according to the online system...  see it believes i qualify for Earned Income Credit,  which sends me back into a loop of filling out the qualifiers, and then i don't qualify but the program doesn't seem to understand why and thus it sends me back to the qualifiers.    i might be really fucking poor, and earned half of what is accepted as the poverity line last year, but i don't qualify for the EIC for one reason i don't understand (nor can control).... i'm still under 25.   (and what is so magical about the age of 25? )   due to my 4 digit year earnings and my 5 digits (soon to be 6 digits) in student loans, i confuse the system.   i might actually have to file my taxes the old fashioned way, because a credit i could receive is 1/3 of what i earned.....
