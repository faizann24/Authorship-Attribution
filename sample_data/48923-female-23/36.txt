i have a fairly uncommon last name (and a fairly uncommon first name, which makes me an easy target of googling), but somehow i find it really shocking that there would be anyone in the entire world with my last name that i don't know already, but i don't even know that many people with my last name.   although i'm related to more people in my first cousin ring, than the populations of some small towns in north dakota, only two of my cousins (as well as my 3 siblings) share the family name.   it seems as if both sets of my grandparents were really really fertile, but the birth of boys didn't seem to go along with the law of averages.   the biggest bummer out of this plight of male children, is i can't as easily stalk family online.  my cousins have more last names than i can ever remember (if i can even recall their first names)...  so even though i have a large entended family, there aren't a lot of people sharing  my  last name.    it makes me feel ultra special because i have the ultimate rock star name.  well, a family member of mine recently died, and i became obsessed with trying to find something mentioning her death in the papers or with google.  and there is a slew of these other people running around the world, with my last name.  most of them might even be related to me.   they're most likely the kids of my dad's cousins several times removed, who comprise these news about sports and academic scores.     these strange people who are running around freely, even though they're tied to me because we share the same last name.
