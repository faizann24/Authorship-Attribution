should you choose to accept it, is to manage 3 fifth grade boys as they perform "community service" by "helping" out in the computer classroom.   actually this means you find yourself spending more time trying to corrall the boys away from causing trouble and also hitting on the girls in the current computer class. what this involves is giving them menial tasks, which you could accomplish quicker than it takes them, and to combat their desire for rewards for their work......    i understand that community service is a great idea, but whose wise idea was it to have kids help out in classrooms of their peers?
