(and if only i could clap off beat... then i'd be set.   years of dance lessons have ensured i will always know the beat, and i'm always puzzled by those who have the ability to completely ignore the beat and clap to some irregular rhythm.)  today i have a song stuck in my head.   oh but it isn't an ordinary song in english, which i could belt out the chorus over-and-over again till i mildly annoy my boyfriend and it flees my mind.  it is a song in another language.  i can't sing in foreign languages.  the phonetics of my own language trip me up frequently, and foreign lyrics twist up my tongue.    but i need to sing the song, and infect my boyfriend's mind with the song in order to release the song from its temporary lodging in my head....
