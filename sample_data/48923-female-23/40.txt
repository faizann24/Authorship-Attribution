clearly, my cat's tail is not  powered by mere kitty muscles...  it is powered by animatronics.   old animatronics, of the sort that you find in theme parks and chuckie cheeses.   as there are two types of movement, that which could be found in nature and then the type that is animatronicized and supposed to resemble nature but fails to resemble anything actually found in nature.  of course this must mean that my cat is part robot.  it is the only way the movement of his tail can be explained, as it jerks as if the cogs are grinding away..  poor little microchip that powers the tail, it must've gotten accidentally wet once.  the tail jerks in ways that disclose their animatronic nature.  as a tangent.  with all of the technology we're supposed to  have, we still can't get  urlLink robots to dance  in a way that looks realistic.   but then again, robots dancing (as well as animatronics) amuse me greatly.
