i think i just lost a year of my life. i would point to some news article about the accident in the lincoln tunnel, and the 1.5 hour wait in purgatory, but there is no news about this yet.  hell, the last accident was only a few weeks ago....  and i really hope that the 90% complete plans for the black wind of death do not involve my tunnel or my metropolitan area.
