image a crowd of theatre goers participating in a full out balloon fight.  lobbing long sausage shaped balloons into the air and at each other.  this might rank as one of my most favorite theatre going moments ever, to the point that i would consider viewing  urlLink carnival knowledge  again.  and i'm not the type of person that ever sees anything twice (unless of course it involves being coerced by a gushing fan girl and carlo rossi)...  but seriously, nothing is more amusing than a bunch of new york theatre goers going crazy with the balloons, to the point that the cast was shocked (from what i heard as i left the theatre) how long the massive balloon fight was.  it was akin to a snowball fight, without all of the messy cold shit.
