there seems to be a game of war going on between the spider plant and the cat, lately.  the cat attempts to eat (or play with) the leaves of the spider plant, whereas the spider plant is becoming skilled at the Drop.  as i don't quite understand spider plant logic, i'm assuming it is trying to attack the attacker..  but of course it could also be trying to flee the situation... or even alert the humans that that cat is being naughty.  thankfully all of the other household plants have stayed out of this current war.  i hope it stays this way, as i fear what will happen when the orchids and the cacti gang up on the cat.
