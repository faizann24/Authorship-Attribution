oh teflon, the wonderful invention that makes pots i don't want to wash a little bit easier to deal with when they are washed. i have given it little thought beyond handling it nicely without using metal objects against it.  (unlike other people who've borrowed and ruined lovely teflon coated pans.)   does anyone give teflon a second thought, beyond the paradox of how teflon can stick to the pan if nothing else can stick to it? well, today i'm here to warn you that teflon has a melting point and even worse a boiling point, which can be achieved on a simple gas stovetop. also, when teflon has reached its melting point, a smell that is reminicent of roasting coffee arrives, which is turned into the worst possible smokey plastic smell imaginable once it boils.  how to boil teflon in three easy steps   decide to reduce some homemade stock for the purpose of the convient idea of storing it in an ice cube tray, to use later.  throw this into a teflon coated pot, and turn the heat on high.  become distracted by something or other and go to a different part of the house, where you completely forget about the stockfilled pot.   we were about to leave the house to go to the big city when the boiling pot of telfon was discovered, which could've caused a nice kitchen fire if left unattended for much longer. this would be the second time scatterbrainess nearly burned down my place of residence.  there was a lovely amount of smoke, but the smoke alarm which mocks me decided not to even beep.
