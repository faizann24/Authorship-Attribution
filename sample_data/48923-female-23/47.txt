it was the spring break that wasn't actually spring due to the repeated snowfalls in the area.    after a day of trudging around the city after the snowfall that didn't want to end, my houseguest and i turned to cooking as an escape from the evil breath of winter. i'm talking about cooking the way old women used to cook, in the ways that Slow Foods people would approve. the delicious way to survive the winter storms.  and it provided all the more reason to giggle and drink copious amounts of tea. we baked and cooked until there was not a single clean dish remaining.  because even though we were being domestic goddesses, the one thing neither of us wants to do is clean.  that is work for the menfolk. we baked and cooked to the point that the fridge and freezer are full of leftovers, to the point that if the food supply was cut off tomorrow, the entire world could subsist on the contents of the fridge.  i'd just hope that they'd help out with the daunting pile of dishes threating to take over my apartment.
