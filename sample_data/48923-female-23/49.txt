okay, so it is snowing and i am extremely bitter, i'm only finding amusement in my small town's lunacy.  i live in a small town outside of a really fucking big city.  the town is quaint and a nice retreat from the city, but sometimes it is really strange how much of a small town mentality it has considering it is 10 minutes away from one of the largest cities in the world.  today's example: it is snowing, and when there is snow on the road people aren't allowed to park on the main (2 lane) street.   this information is of course posted along the main street, along with the PICK UP YOUR SHIT signs that amuse me to no end.   it is snowing and the cops are bored or maybe they're always bored especially when it is snowing.  but the cops decide to slowly go down the street with their sirens and a loud speaker.  perhaps i would understand what they're saying if i was outside, or had all of my windows open.  but the snow is coming down at a 45 degree angle and i like keeping my apartment warm.  whatever they are saying, i could guess it has something to do with the snow on the road and the inevitable ticket and tow that will happen to the unfortunate cars still parked on the main street.  what amuses me the most is that they'll slowly drive down the street with sirens blaring, and will stop to talk  when they reach a car , as if the car will understand and decide to move itself.    their owners are most likely still at work, but the cops somehow believe the loudspeakers will move the cars and will alert the people who don't read the signs that their cars need to move.  the other amusing twist, is that the loudspeaker talking resembles english.  most of the people who live around here are not native english speakers.
