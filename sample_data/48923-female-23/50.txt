i fear i am doomed and that the clouds which bring snow love me.  this week is supposed to be my spring break from school, and the last few days have seemed like spring (the forgotten season where i used to live) and the last month there hasn't been a need for heat to be on in my apartment.  but now it is snowing.  little by little, i really despise the snow.  here i was looking forward to a week in city with my house guest, with a camera instead of a winter coat, to go around checking out the budding leaves and the springing flowers.   curses.
