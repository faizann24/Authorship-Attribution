no one ever says they want to be an information architect when they grow up.  maybe because information architects didn't exist when most adults were kids. hell most people most people don't know what information architects are.  all i do know, is that after today's guest lecture in one of my classes, i wanna be an info architect.  just the name alone sounds sexy.  at this point, i'm guessing, most people are lost.  well for today's educational piece we'll talk about information architects.  they make information sexy by making it easy to the point that users don't need to think.   here's an example to make this less abstract: have you ever been to a website (or used some product) where you were completely lost?  where navigation makes you want to bang your head against the wall?    well, this is the example of someone who didn't use an i.a.   of course at this point the thought might be brewing of, "jesus, *ialmostslippedandtypedmyrealname*  i've seen the state of your room/apartment/desk/backpack you can't honestly be an organized individual."  ah, but i'm a perfectionist when it comes to organization.  the reason for the mess is completely a result of my laziness of maintain perfection all the time.     (i love pyschotically organizing things.)
