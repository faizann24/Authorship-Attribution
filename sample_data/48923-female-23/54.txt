I'm having a hell week, all of my finals (which unfortunately requires you) are due this week.   If you crash one more time in the middle of a VERY IMPORTANT YET NOT RECENTLY SAVED final project one more time-- I will resort to violence. Hell, I might even switch to a Mac. It is imperative that you do not crash and ruin several hours of work.  I have shit due tomorrow, and you should be on my side.  love, your disgruntled user
