today, i struggled with finding the symbol for multiplication on my keyboard. no, not the asterisk (which is the cheater's way out of multiplication) because it hadn't crossed my mind...   i was seriously scouring my keyboard's top row for the little "x".   until, i realized...  well.  "X" is a letter and "*" is for computer multiplication.  and it is only monday. and i'm already exhausted.
