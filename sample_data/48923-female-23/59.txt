i know you're extremely excited about your recent discovery of open windows +window sills,  it must be extremely entertaining to have more things for you to study in between naps.  but do you have to get stuck on the bathroom windowsill?  you got up there somehow, why can't you figure out how to get down? you know i'm a sucker for your pitiful cry, thus i rescued you three times today.  but what happens when i'm not home to rescue you from the bathroom window perch?  in case you've forgotten, cats land feet first.  you'll be okay.   the jump looks more daunting than it actually is.  btw, how the hell are you jumping up there anyway?  love, the woman who gives you catnip
