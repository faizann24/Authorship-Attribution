we will never order from you again.  sure you snagged us in with the niced looking menu (in comparison to the million other chinese delivery places) and your effort in displaying your delivered foods. but clearly, after delivering us a mess of plain steamed spinach looking stuff (and charging us 13 dollars for this stuff) instead of what we actually ordered, then the fight on the phone... then when the originally ordered dish came quite some time later, the dance of the delivery boy was completely innappropriate. do you think we're grade schoolers, when you expect us to give back the wrongfully delivered dish before giving us the rightfully ordered dish?  i mean, what the hell?   with service like that, i almost want to start a rumor about you using cat and dog meat in your dishes.
