there was this point when i felt sorry for kids growing up in the city.   because they didn't have a big house and a backyard.  i remember a children's story about a girl that didn't have a yard, and the only flowers she had in front of her house were ones she drew in chalk on the sidewalk.  but after working with kids who are growing up in the city...   i'd trade my childhood-backyard  for their plethora of cultural institutions in a heartbeat.    i'd give up sled riding on those few snow days, mud walks, the great wall of china (a bank of the creek covered in pieces of colored rocks), the island of nimh (past the point in the backyard were i couldn't see the house, and i'd always get in trouble), the stinkbomb wars, and hot chocolate picnics all for the city art safari.......
