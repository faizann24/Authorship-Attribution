usually technology and i get along wonderfully.  but today i was present for multiple computer meltdowns, (tim- macs suck), server meltdowns (the computer at the bank  broke  today. couldn't get money and couldn't deposit.), and other things that result in my choice of  urlLink The System is Down  as today's theme song.
