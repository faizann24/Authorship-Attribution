taking the silliness of BundtÂ to a whole new level   there is a time in your life when everyone needs a BundtÂ pan.   okay, not really.  but just say, you were temporarily cataloguing your own collection of silly gadgets to recall if you do, in fact, own a bundt pan.  or you might be puzzling over what the hell this bundt thing is.  a bundt pan is a glorified (trademarked) cake pan, although it seems like it could hold other purposes.  it is special because instead of being a traditional flat shape, it is fluted and thus the resulting cake hugs every drop of frosting applied to it.  up until recently, i didn't own a bundt pan.  now usually (for those of you who stay as far away from the kitchen as possible) cake pans are created out of some sort of metal. something that will be able to withstand its time baking inside of an oven.   but the bundt pan i acquired is special...    (note to self for later, i should take a picture instead of using amazon's picture.)  not only is this bundt pan not made out of metal, but it is flexible and flaming red.  i must repeat: flexible and flaming red!!!  seriously what more could you want in bakeware? this is quitpossiblyly the silliest kitchen item i own.  more silly than my milk frother, and better humored than my beautiful blue glass cups. (i currently have a theory that everything tastes better out of thcobaltlt blue cups. i like looking a the blue-tinted world thru the bottom of my glass.)  the bundt pan imesmerisingng like silly putty. it bends, twists, springs back to shape, and you can bake cakes in it.   and the whole thing is made out of silicone, which adds another dimension of silliness?  (arsiliconon breast implants as bendable and can be used for cake baking?)  i'm easily amused by kitchen gadgets.
