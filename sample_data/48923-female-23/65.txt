[recently, i have decided that for some reason my cursing tongue has dried up.  i blame working with children, and having to censor myself around them.  i don't even fucking say my favorite phrase of "bloody hell" any more.  what's happening to me?  i actually wonder if i should hang around the  urlLink visiting sailors  to revitalize my cursing tongue.]  will i ever be able to find a yoga teacher in this fucking city, who has at least been practicing yoga for longer than i have?  it seems like all i can find are ex-dancers who were certified a year or so ago at some questionable institute. certified yoga teachers scare me.  perhaps they shouldn't scare me because they're  certified , but to me that means they paid for some course that might've taught them a few things and now they feel like they can teach.  which seems very american and anti-yoga. to counteract the fucking certified yoga teachers, i only want to take yoga classes from old hippies (cause i'm more likely to believe that they've been practicing for a long time, unlike the certified) or from people actually from India.
