there was a certain time, before my beloved  urlLink google  existed, that i loved  urlLink ask jeeves .   AskJeeves was a brilliant idea, to use natural language for searching.  when Ask Jeeves came out, i was enamored by him, but i believe this might be because i'm a search engine junkie. (i love love love google.)  but i lost my faith in jeeves, his answers started to suck after Ask was gobbled up by some other dotcompany.  (but i guess this isn't about how i'm bitter towards jeeves. i really wish he'd listen to the questions of others.  and i really wish he'd get over that whole top frame, making sure people never really leave him.)   today in the computer classroom where i work,  the teacher decided to use Jeeves as a research tool for our second grade class.  there is always a flock of kids who won't understand anything that goes on in the computer room at any cost.  but then there are the handful of kids who'll get really excited about whatever today's activity entails.  certain kids, became more excited over the idea of posing a stumping question to Jeeves, than what their results may have been.  these are my favorite questions:  Why do humans create animals?   What am I? (i'm amused by the idea of 2nd graders sitting around having conversations about metaphysics.) Is GOD REAL?   (followed by the kid saying to me.  "I'm Jewish.  I want to know.")
