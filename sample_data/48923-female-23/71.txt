the summer has officially begun for me, and i have already begun to worry if the World's library system has started posting warnings about me.  you might be wondering why, or perhaps how could such a sweet little cynical girl could have a library problem.  i'm notorious for overdue books.  notorious to the point that i've maxed out my library card in 6 localities, 2 universities, and several counties. i've also maxed out the cards of others.  they knew fully well about my habit yet allowed me to check out books on their card.  (point and laugh shall we?) i try my damnest to keep my cards clean, but the fines always seem to exponentially stack up.  i believe it all began when i was a small child and the fact that my favorite book at the time happened to belong to the library. but it is still in my possession. i've been told that the book was "paid" thru the fines, and not to long after my family moved to a different city for fear of the wrath of the librarians.  fast forward a bunch of years, and i wonder if the only reason libraries lend me books is in hope of the late fees paying for their new section.  "Ah, yes the the new ydeleK wing..."      despite my trouble with fines, i truly love libraries. it is the combination of orderliness, air conditioning, information, and mostly free library books.  ah, so the summer has officially started.  i have a pristine new library card (why are librarians suckers?) and an  urlLink amazon.com wishlist  full of books i should get around to reading.      do you have any recommendations for summer reading?
