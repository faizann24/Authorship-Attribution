my group visited our professor's manhattan office today, to give our final presentation.  and something about waiting momentarily in the lobby maybe me feel like a little kid waiting for daddy at the office, except my feet aren't dangling in the air when i was sitting on the lobby chair. i wonder if the toys around the lobby, and the telephone walking tour guide around the displays, increased my feeling-like-a-little-kid-ness.   (i don't want to patiently sit in the chair and think about the presentation, i want to run across the room and play with that  thing  over there.) i'm rather sad that the class is over, and that i'm staring at a summer (i hate the summer) with no structure  and a summer without  urlLink woxy . (bah, yesterday they were on the letter "I" and now they're on the letter "M,"  urlLink fuckfuckfuck  its ending too quickly and i haven't recorded as much as i've wanted to. *sobs*) hell, i would like the chance to be a little kid again. on that note, on my walk home from public transit... i had an elderly asian (most likely korean, knowing my area) crossing guard help me walk across the street.  [random ydelek trivia: i never got the chance to cross the street with a crossing guard as a kid]   amusingly, he said an asian accented "adios" after my thank you.
