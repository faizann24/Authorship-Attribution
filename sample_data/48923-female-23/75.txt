i am a puddle, as  urlLink my favorite radio station   (the only one out there worth listening to) is going off the air this week.  where will i go to listen to music?  where will i go to listen to music that isn't just the same 20 songs played  ad nauseum  with loads of commercials in between?   where will i go for the mix of new and old, imports and unsigned cincy bands, techno and hip hop?  this is worse than the break-up of my favorite band, that i idolized during my teen years.  this is worse than the last death of a family member.     urlLink woxy  is apart of my daily life, as i'm constantly streaming it when i'm home (cleaning, doing homework, surfing, etc.)   i'm afraid of the silence that will follow.   i'm afraid of life without the  urlLink future of rock 'n roll .   and i'm a huge puddle of tears.
