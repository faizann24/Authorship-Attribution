if you miss a flight, especially the last flight of the day from your chosen east coast airport going to your west coast destination,  groveling cannot make another airplane appear.  but it can rescue your ticket (instead of paying a thousand bucks for a replacement) if you focus all your happy energy at the ticket agent.  honestly, i'm unsure where my happy energy came from... after missing the flight we were very close to giving up on the whole "flying off to the other coast and seeing a music festival" thing, because it was a terribly long week of horrid final projects (for me) and horrid working overtime (for the bf) which essentially meant very little sleep all week.  (i believe i averaged 4 hours of sleep a night, that week.)  but from somewhere came that chipper person buried deep inside of me, to convince the ticket agent that we could stay in minneapolis overnight, keep our regular ticket, and fly out early in the morning to california.  after a stressful time, calling everyone in our party that we weren't going to be on the airplane as scheduled (3 groups of people from 3 different places were all going to meet up on the same airplane to california.)  and there is a certain amount of hell we received from the hotel industry, when trying to change the reserved name over to the name of someone who'd actually be in california that night.  stand-by was our only hope.   stand-by to minneapolis worked in the computers, but we'd have to later beg our way onto the stand-by list to california a day later.  thankfully the stand-by gods were smiling at us.
