the scab glistened, nearly resembling a capital A, on the tender underside of her forearm.   there was something scary and yet glamorous about the thing at the time, perhaps because it was on someone slightly older than me, that i admired. i was still a pre-teen, and the fresh scab seemed beautiful. i just didn't understand the reason, yet.  i was never a self-injurer. though i could see the romance of the pain and the flowing blood, to the point that i became fearful of scarp knives.  i might've dreamed about all of the different ways i could kill myself, but i never actually had the guts to start the process when others did.  ... she had puckered stripes on her arms.  lines that tangoed with her veins.  lines across the veins of someone i cherish..  she made up a horrible lie when i causally asked about a few whose cover slipped away. i dropped the subject, but am still unsure what to do... what happens if she hits cutting success?
