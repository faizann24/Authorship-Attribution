there is a certain image in my head that i conjure up for a person named billy or a person named frank.  in my mind, a billy is youngish, lanky, wears v-neck sweaters, and is always slightly disheveled.  a frank is someone at least in their 60's, white, grandfatherish, completely gray and prolly bald.  in my new classes, it was shocking to see how my new profs (a billy and a frank) are nothing like my idealized versions.  frank is youthful and jolly, and billy would fit better if his name is frank.
