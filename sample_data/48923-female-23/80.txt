i think i've previously ranted about the condition of the roads in new jersey. (the idea of a handful of tangled spaghetti being tossed on a map, and then made into real roads... seems like the best description i have.)   well, we have rarely dealt with traffic on these roads.  especially the friday afternoon new york commuter traffic variety. little did we realize, nyc traffic is never on your side.  we set out from our place with plenty of time before take off, we would've been sitting around in the boring newark terminal for a rather long time if it had taken the usual 20 minutes to get to the airport.  little did we expect that we'd get stuck at an intersection that leads to a highway onramp (tollway?) for a large chunk of time...  only to find out after another large chunk of time that that this onramp was closed.    and the next onramp for this highway was on the other side of 20 red light intersections which were  crammed to gridlock with cars.  i have been close for flights before.  i actually am still amused by the pre 9-11 days of being the last person on the aircraft, and how i'd beat the airport wait system.  (i've begun to wonder if hell isn't actually centered in the mall of america, but actually inside of every airport terminal.)  i had hopes that we'd be able to have the travel gods smile upon us with a slightly delayed flight out of newark.  but would i be writing this if they had?  we know we're short on time, i make it thru phone prompt hell to coerce a customer service rep to hold the flight.... we're only a few minutes late, we can run once we're at the airport.. right?  the plane of course has an ontime departure.  and we make it to the gate a few minutes too late.
