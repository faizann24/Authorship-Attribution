i've been too mentally exhausted to go anywhere near unpacking the items crammed into my suitcase.   it feels like i've been half across the country  in the past few weeks possibly because i have  (8 different states and a district of columbia).   in reinventing an old form of mental diversion possibly because my last trip left me with a bitter taste, i've taken to dreaming about the trips that could be.  this involves travel mags, and a little too much time comparing the cruelty of international flights being cheaper than domestic.  well, except of course flights to asia which floor me just by being 4 digits in price.   i'll prolly compulsively scout for 3 digits, if just for the thrill of seeing where the connecting flights land, until time stops being fickle.  i am absolutely afraid of wide open spaces (inverse claustrophobia, i guess) places where there is nothing to visually grab on to protect me.  a prime example of such a place would be found in parking lots near amusement parks (notably king's island), and i'm terrified that i will float off just because there is nothing else around.   if you've seen me ice skate (i'm a bar hugger who is terrified to let go), you might have an image of how i act in wide open spaces.     well, it seems the same exists when i am given a vast empty space of time. i'm struggling not to get sucked into the empty vortex yet... but...   i hate free time.  (cursed being a P yet needing to be a J.)   on another note, i have added 2 more states to the list of states that ought to be destroyed during the revolution.    Alabama (imagine driving for hours on an uninteresting 2 lane country road, where the only excitement is trying to pass cars in the incoming traffic's lane at 80 mph. pure waste of space.)  Delaware  (it has a city named dover in it, what other reasons do you need besides it is a evil waste of space? for those new to the game dover, england is competing for the prize of worst place in the entire world.)
