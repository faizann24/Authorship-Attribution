now that i'm no longer on the road, i would like a moment of silence for  urlLink mary's   urlLink uncle bernie .                       i wish i could be there for you and your family.     (mary, a strange thought... we've known each other longer that my baby brother has been alive. he and i were talking about the news of your uncle, and said something along the lines of we've been friends forever.  and i guess in his book that's true.)
