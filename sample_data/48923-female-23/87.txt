if i was myself (which i hope i am) where would i hide my sunglasses?  it seems i have a higher probability of losing something (or convenient placing something somewhere where i'll remember it, but in fact forget) right before leaving on a trip.  and this doesn't help matters as i become slightly neurotic before trips so every lost/misplaced item magnifies the pre-trip neurotic jitters.  perhaps my sunglasses are inside of something (thus i'll have an excavation of every purse, bag, drawer, and suitcase i own), or on top of something but now hiding under something.   i wish i knew what i was thinking when i hid them, in hopes that would give insight into their current location...   (if i can't find them, maybe i'll have to take a trip to the airport lost-n-found and seek out a new pair of glasses...)
