as a kid, i cried when reagan left office.  i didn't understand why he couldn't stay and why they needed someone else because he was the president for  my entire life  at that point.  this is where i begin to think i could be completely happy with a little bit of monarchy, someone who is a figurehead and has no real power except the power of media distraction.   too bad we have a presidency instead.  --  we went out to a diner last night, to escape the oppressive heat that turned my mind into mush and my butter dish's butter into liquid.  and it was hard to escape the constant broadcast of the corpse of reagan.  at least i wish we could see the corpse of reagan, not the buttons down the back of nancy's dress or the draped american flag.  and i don't understand why they shipped the dead reagan body across the country for a little expo of his flag draped coffin in d.c., only to ship it back across to california for the final resting spot.  i wonder if i'm the only person who doubts there is a reagan in that coffin, and would really like to see some dead reagan for my tax dollars.   the russians managed to display lenin's corpse (is he still on display?) for a rather long time... why couldn't the smithsonian have an exhibit of presidential corpses, instead of the dresses of first ladies?  it would be nice to know that i could visit and see for myself the corpses behind the scratched plexiglass, and i think it might be a nice way to weed out potential presidential candidates... as they would know their body was doomed to be behind plexiglass instead of a soft coffin for all of eternity....
