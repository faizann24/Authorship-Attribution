i wish there was a way to transform a messy apartment, where you can see the dust settling on the last suitcase and all of the forgotten item, into a clean apartment...  somehow it is depressing to come home to an extremely messy apt, reeking of single boy with dishes still in the sink from when you last left, and feeling upset over his grandiose attempt to do the laundry instead of  cleaning..   and doing the laundry of course means that he did all of the laundry in that pile of gentles that aren't supposed to go thru a dryer, and now they're all sitting shrunk and crumpled in a pile in a laundry basket.
