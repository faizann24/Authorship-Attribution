and i'm already contemplating calling up my blog to randomly sing (poorly) at it.   i'm not even drunk (yet).  this would be to dislodge the catchy earworm (is that the decided upon name for songs that get lodged in your head?) i currently have.  of course, being that i'm sober, i realize that i'm the sole person here rocking out to this song in my underwear in front of the air conditioning. (yes, i have no will power when it comes to heat and the air conditioner is cranked, after pretending all day i didn't need it.)  and my singing will not inspire others to rock-out to this song (although it is a  perfect  rock-out song).  i'll just silently dance over hear, with myself.  you can sing the song (if you know what it is, which i doubt)  if you want.  also, dear readers.  you've been warned about the potential blog songs.  be afraid, cause i know i'm terrified.
