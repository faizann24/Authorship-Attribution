today's confession:  i lived in this state for a few months shy of a year, and i still haven't bothered to get a new driver's license.  there are loads of excuses (i know, i know i was supposed to get a new license within the first 60 or so days of living here.  i've been chewed out at the DMV before) which i'll condense to two things.   grad school (which made it easy to put everything off for that next day in the near distance future when i'll get enough sleep and everything will be shiny-happy)  insurance    i wonder if this state realizes that advertising it being  the most expensive state for car insurance in the union  is really going to make anyone want to get rid of their previous insurance.   i might be okay with paying double my previous rent, but to quadruple the insurance?  uh, i've been in no hurry for that.  but it is nearing that time when getting a new license is vitally important.  (that whole fear i have due to whenever i temporarily lose my old license, plus can't renew car tags in a state i have no residence.)   and i'm now terrified that i'll fail the driver's knowledge test because i don't know the finer points of the graduated licenses and stuff of that pointless nature.  ...
