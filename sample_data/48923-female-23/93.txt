(cue the theme to attack of the killer tomatoes)  there has been an outbreak at my job (an elementary school, for those of you new to the game) of head lice.  the school has brought out backup troops, and has been scouring the head of every child in search for the bugs.  which has depleted classes of most of their students.  the nurse's office has become an overfilling party room/ quarantine area where kids compare how many where found on their heads.  and i'm terrified.  see, i've never had head lice.  as a child i somehow managed to keep my head safe during the grade school outbreaks, always slightly jealous of all the kids who'd get to go home...   i'm still scarred by the times i was attacked by chiggers and ticks, to the point that i still fear the great outdoors.   -- she grabs my hair to get my attention.  "Yyyyydelekk, i think i have lice." as she scratches her dreads.    i'm not sure if i am a responsible enough adult to not freak out at those words.  distancing myself from her, i told her to go to the nurse. -- there are nearly-broken headphones in my computer lab.  everytime a child has a problem with their headphones, they want me to test them and make it all better. i can only test them by having them on my head.  -- kids love using headphones, be it to hear silly program sounds or to find their own sounds online.   plus they love sharing with me, where i'll usually feign enthusiastic interest.   sometimes this will involve the children thrusting their headphones at me.  --  i'm unsure of how exactly kids catch lice. (breebot, would you know?)  i'm terrified that they're crawling all over me trying to find a resting spot as i type.  i hope i'm just being a hypocondriac and scratching the bugs that aren't really there.
