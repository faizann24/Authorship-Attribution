maybe not all of new york has a large price tag.     &nbsp;  my little sister and i were out walking from one place to another in hopes of shooting pictures when the flooding&nbsp;downpour began.&nbsp;&nbsp; it was one of those downpours that weather.com failed to predict, and wouldn't have happened if either of us had thought to bring an umbrella.   as the rain hammered down there really was no where to run for cover, and it was one of those&nbsp;warm summer rains that didn't seem so bad as it soaked through our clothing.&nbsp;  until we started to catch a chill, of course.   it was one of those few instances where i'd catch a ride with a stranger, or hail a cab...&nbsp; but the road was&nbsp;empty.   we walk further down the road, our flip flops start sliding around on our feet and water is dripping thru our eyebrows...&nbsp; when a cabbie calls out at us if we want a ride.   we slide onto the leather backseat, dripping water into the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;   driving us to our destination  (which if we had walked it, we would've been able to start our own swimming pool with how soaked we would've been)   and i try to hand him some money.    "No Charge."&nbsp; he says with a smile.&nbsp;
