i've noticed that after a lifetime of computer usage, i have never taken a class where i actually learnt how to use a computer program.  usually, i've learnt how to use computer programs the same way i learnt how to use a computer by a combination of luck and disaster on my own.   i have been the person in front of a room, explaining how to use a specific computer program, but i've never been facing the computer while a teacher talks in the front of the room.  it is the strangest sensation. (i must keep my ego in check.)  i have already jumped to the aid of a fellow classmate.  it is like during the class i know i'm just a student, but as soon as the call for help  i swoop in and help because everything we've learned thus far makes complete sense to an old-time computer user.   but, there is also a problem with everything making sense and seeming easy...  essentially it means my mind starts to wander or want a fast forward button for parts of the class.  i've caught myself wandering and then find out that i missed a quick explanation of something i don't already know.    there is also something very strange about learning how to use a program correctly, instead of a explorations leading to discovery and insight about a program. when i've learned programs on my own, i'll have to rely upon help files or google-- it is strange to have a living body in the room for questions and problems.   of course that self-learner inside of me would rather figure it out on my own, or eavesdrop on the help the teacher gives to the completely clueless students.
