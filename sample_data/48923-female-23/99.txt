(i'm currently angry at broadway.)  in the strange contradiction of being annoyed at how prudish americans were over a nipple at the superbowl -- i've reached my limit with senseless nudity in theatre.  it isn't the nakedness itself that troubles me, it is all in the framing.  from a historical standpoint, acting has been a male profession with most female roles (if there were any) were played in men in drag or by female sex workers.   this has trickled into the modern era, where it seems there are fewer parts for females in comparison to males and the parts for the few females seems to include a rather lot of nakedness.  pointless nakedness.   nakedness that usually fails to further the plot, and only shows the audience how perky or saggy the breasts and buttocks of Miss Naked Actress are.   in a way it kills the plot because the director could only resort to using one of the few female actresses as shock value.   how shocking, what a spectacle, a naked lady!   in helping fuel my anger, it seems that there are a plethora of male characters and roles but females are typecast into a few.   she's either the sex-pot, or the crone, insane or motherly.... seldomly a positive role model, and usually only an accessory to the male actors.
