Good morning! Well, back to some of that random pop phenomenon...apparently there is more boyband sniping going on. It seems to me they'd be better off if they quit fighting and started dating each other. I don't know...what do you think? Heavyweight Boy Band Wars Rage On *NOTE* I do not endorse the whole BSB vs *NSYNC thing - this is just a report I found and thought some people might find it interesting. As Justin said "Don't get your panties in a wad" over it :) (12/10) from : Two members of the BACKSTREET BOYS, Kevin Richardson and Nick Carter, have made a verbal attack against 'Nsync.       The boys claim in the latest issue of Live And Kicking magazine that their band have had to do all the grafting, whilst their rivals have just followed their lead.       They are also bitter that their management company created Nsync while the Backstreet Boys were on a world tour.       Nick raged, I think if there wasnt a Backstreet Boys there wouldnt have been an Nsync. No one has any idea how hard we had to work in Europe to make it.       Kevin added, We dont have anything against them personally but it is annoying to me how they came to be.       Our management company created Nsync in our image once we were successful.       He continued, They went to all the same producers, on all the same tours and met all the same people. In the end it was like all the doors we kicked open, they just walked through.       Certainly Nsync have been successful  picking up four US Billboard awards earlier this week. Their No Strings Attached album also shifted 2.4 million copies in its first week of release, a record for the fastest selling album.
