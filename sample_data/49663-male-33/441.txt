my big gay life [17]  Last night was both  big  and  gay . It was everything I expected...and  less . It was really quite unextraordinary, actually. I met the guys at the Lizard as planned. It was teeming with hetero folks and a handful of the tribe. We drank a couple of pitchers of Killian's Red (semi-butch) and snacked on some appetizers (totally gay). The place got incredibly crowded and the scenery got better. Cuties everywhere! God, I love baseball! Anyway, deliriously buzzed, we walked over to Jacob's Field for the game. I was shocked at how amazing our seats were...4 rows from the dugout...close enough to see the players. However, we were also close to all the 50-something, white-collar pudgies who are the only people who can afford the $45 ticket price.  There, no more than 15 feet away, was  urlLink Omar Vizquel , object of my mad crush for 5 or 6 seasons. His pic in the link doesn't do him justice at all. Anyway, we all had a great evening at the ballpark...but it didn't end there. We all agreed to make a stop at the legendary and notorious  urlLink Leather Stallion . After another drink (they make 'em  strong  there) Pat, Jim, Phil and I all sat out on the patio enjoying the beautiful night. It was a great change of pace and change of scenery. Not a huge fan of sweet drinks, here. but the Stallion makes  incredibly narcotic  Long Island Iced Tea...just one will have your lips numb. Over the years, Phil and I have managed to get into tons of trouble with the LSS as our starting point. Last night felt like a reunion. Not much has changed there. But I have. It's hard to even remember the person I was back those 10 or so years ago.
