my big gay life (36)   I have spent the better part of the week hyper-caffeinated thanks to my good friends at  urlLink Starbucks . This level of caffeination brings one a certain level of clarity (so I've heard). I've yet to discover it. We're all back at work after our one day respite. I think of my friend Jennie over in the UK enjoying her summer. She quit her job a few weeks back, made a quick trip to the States, and is now back freelancing and sleeping-in a lot. In a recent email, she said that she's been catching-up on her sleep (that's rough) and spending lots of time down at the pub. Huh. That sounds pretty good to me right about now. Let's see, rehearsals have been going well...grueling and often running late into the night. However, we are making great headway and having really way too much fun while we're at it. This week's challenge is to find a cool pair of spectator shoes (black and white wing tips) and to drill the brand-new choreography for  Razzle Dazzle  into my head. Nothing spectacular going on personally, but that's really quite alright. Oh yes, Miss Kelly returned from her Sabbatical to Colorado...she's in love. She wants to move to the Rockies and marry her a big, burly mountain man. So, in the next few weeks, I'll hopefully be helping her prepare for the big move...she seems so happy and excited by it that I hope she really follows-through with it. Anyhow, back to the daily grind for me. Hope everyone had a happy 4th. Talk to you later...
