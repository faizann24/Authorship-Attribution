I haven't felt this anxious since the spring of 1998, when my world caved inward under the enormous corporate pressure of four 800-pound gorillas:  urlLink Chicago ,  urlLink Rent ,  urlLink Disney's Beauty and the Beast  and  urlLink Riverdance . Like then, I have that sinking, sick feeling in my stomach, things change from day to day and I am uncertain. I flinch every time the phone rings. Thankfully, I had only one day of this. Yesterday, I had a nice family (30 or so people) dinner celebrating my sister and aunt's birthdays. As I was driving home, I received two squirrelly messages on my voicemail at home. One, a friend asking me to dinner one night this week. His tone and his voice registered alarm...although the casual listener would hear very little...I know my friend well. What I couldn't decide was if this was going to be about me and our friendship, or if it was something else entirely. I will find out Tuesday, when we have dinner together at his house. I just can't help but notice when something seems awry. Then, I received a message from another friend, with yet more unresolved issues. And, as much as I understand that we live in the gray...not much is black and white...I was just needing things to feel a little more...well...Zebra. Those two calls piled up with the fact that the producers of the current national tour I'm working on are getting mighty worried about the financials here in Cleveland. It seems that my advertising plan needs to be scoured, scrutinized and re-analyzed...this is enough to make anyone in the ad biz squirrelly, and I am squirrellier than a 3M Post-Its commercial. Anyhow, I know how to deal with this anxiety...god knows I've done it before. I spoke to the producers and we're working things out. I spoke to my friend & we're having dinner. I left a message for my other friend, so we'll see what happens. I've done all I could do for today. Why is finding a little inner peace and quiet so tough sometimes?
