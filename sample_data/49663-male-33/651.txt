garons endommags (damaged boys)       twelve      someday well know        Marcus, circa 1994. Hed graduated in the top fifth percentile of the class, beating out almost all the well-established Southern legacy students with names like Thurman, Burwell, Lee and Marshall. Hed managed to navigate the treacherous maze of academia and politics without even outing himself. In the South, even on a college campus, being gay was not anything to wave a flag aboutor have a parade. Or even say out loud. No, Marcus has managed to survive four brutal years, four incredibly challenging and stimulating years at the nations oldest institution of higher learning. It was a major feat that hed survived, the College of William and Mary had the highest rate of student suicide anywhere in the world. Hed arrived at William and Mary by way of his academic prowess, charm and athletic ability. Marcus received a full academic and athletic scholarship for four years. Maybe hed have done well to join his classmates in the political arena in Washington, or in New York. He had classmates in the international arenas, too. Michael Marchaud worked for the French Embassy in New York. Hed  used his excellent grades and a few family connections to land his tony employment with Ambassador Chartres in Manhattan. Although he would have preferred a placement in Europe or Asia, he was thrilled to be in the capital city of the western hemisphere. New York also allowed him to be in the same country as Marcus, and close to key influencers in the world of international politics.    Marcus was not interested at all in becoming or being a key influencer, he never had been. But, here, in his life in pharmaceutical sales, hed become just that, the central figure in his office and certainly within his various social circles. Everyone always wanted to know what he was doing, what he thought of everything and anything, and wanted to be around him just because he was Marcus. It all seemed exceedingly silly to him, although he remembered growing up, the sixth grade in particular, when he would never have imagined any modicum of personal popularity. He was not liked. He was scrawny and uncomfortable in his own skin. The other boys could smell his weakness and often taunted him, threatened him. So, this sudden adoration as an adult seemed odd and fleeting. Hed not been interested in what others thought, and he thought it foolish that people were interested in his. Nonetheless, he understood the circumstances, he understood the implied responsibility.     Michael was in his World Politics course during their sophomore year. Hed noticed him in class, but the two actually met during a jog through the historic district in Colonial Williamsburg. Michael had just completed a two mile jaunt and was starting his cool-down near Merchants Square when he saw Marcus run from the Wren Building on campus toward Duke of Gloucester Street. It was exactly three quarters of a mile to the Capitol at the opposite end of the street, so Michael followed, unnoticed at first. By the time Marcus reached Bruton Parish, Michael had cinched the distance between them and said hello. Marcus nodded, but said nothing until hed completed five miles, Michael trailing all the while. Marcus broke the silence.     "You kept up for five miles. Not bad!"   "Seven."   "That was five."   "Ah yes, but I had completed two miles before joining you. But you make a very attractive incentive to keep running."     Marcus smiled, and for once, he welcomed the attention. It marked the beginning of an incredible four years between them. Before the other men, before it was complicated by distance and ambiguitybefore things got deadly.
