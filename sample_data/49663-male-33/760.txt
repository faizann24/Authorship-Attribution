This circus is falling down on its knees   The big top is crumbling down  It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east  Where you should be, no one's around      I need a phone call  I need a raincoat  I need a big love  I need a phone call      These train conversations are passing me by  And I don't have nothing to say  You get what you pay for  But I just had no intention of living this way      I need a phone call  I need a plane ride  I need a sunburn   I need a raincoat      And I get no answers  And I don't get no change  It's raining in Baltimore, baby  But everything else is the same      There's things I remember and things I forget  I miss you  I guess that I should  Three thousand five hundred miles away  But what would you change if you could?      I need a phone call   Maybe I should buy a new car  I can always hear a freight train  If I listen real hard  And I wish it was a small world  Because I'm lonely for the big towns  I'd like to hear a little guitar   I think it's time to put the top down      I need a phone call  I need a raincoat     Words & Music by: Adam Duritz
