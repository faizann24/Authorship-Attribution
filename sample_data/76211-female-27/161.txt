urlLink    National Campus Band Comp - Melbourne or Bust   Yay, I love packing for Melbourne. :-) It's  urlLink Band Comp  time again folks. The National Final takes place Thurs. night, October 24th at The Corner Hotel in Richmond. Be there! My plane leaves @ 5pm, so I will have to haul ass to the hotel straight from the airport. Got the video cam, the digital cam, and regular cam. I better get some good footage!  Also very much looking forward to catching up with all my cute little Melbourne punks, you know who you are. I'm very lucky to have such nice friends to stay with in Melb, won't have to worry about the joys of a hostel.   So yeah, I'm off tomorrow night, and then will stay the weekend, coming back to Syd. on Sunday arvo. Happy Birthday for Friday the 25th in advance to my Daddy. Congratulations, Dad! You'll be 50, and twice my age, and still younger than Patrick Swayze who turned 50 in August (I'm sick, I know!) And Happy Belated B-day to my lil' cousin Seanie T! (I know, I know, you're not that little! ;-)  This pic is another one from the last party @ The Primes, a nice group shot. I don't know how I always manage to end up in the middle of group photos. I don't plan it, it just kinda happens. Weird.  Have a great one, folks. Looking forward to telling tales when I get back..."This one time, at Band Comp..." ;-)
