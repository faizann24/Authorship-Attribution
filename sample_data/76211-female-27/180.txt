Christmas in Western Australia/New Year's in Sydney  urlLink Slideshow/Photogallery      A New Year's Tale    It's New Year's down at Rushcutter's Bay, Sydney. Perfect view of the Harbour Bridge, and LORI takes a pic of the gang. BEN offers to take a photo so LORI can be in it, but then a RANDOM MAN offers to take a photo. The gang poses, then they get ready to watch fireworks and toast with champagne..    CROWD:  10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...Happy New Year!  GANG:  Cheers, everyone! (clinking glasses)  C.J.:  Okay, who wants some love? Who wants a hug? (C.J. proceeds to hug Dave, Stu, Lori, Emma, Ben, etc)   RANDOM MAN:  I'd like some love - you got any champagne to spare?  STU:  Sure, you did take our picture and all....(STU gives RANDOM MAN and RANDOM MAN'S WIFE some champagne)  RANDOM MAN:  Thanks very much! Cheers!   Later on...    LORI  (to gang) : The fireworks kicked ass once again!  RANDOM MAN:  Yeah, those fireworks were absolutely amazing.  LORI:  (noticing accent) Hey, where are you from?  RANDOM MAN:  We're from Canada. We're Canadian.  LORI:  (raising glass) Well, Happy New Year, fellow North Americans! Whereabouts in Canada are you from?  RANDON MAN:  Vagina. We're from Vagina.   (long shocked awkward silence)    LORI exits the 'stage', laughing her ass off. EMMA looks puzzled and turns to BEN who is laughing at LORI laughing and shaking.     STU:  (confused) Um, did he say what I think he said?  EMMA:  What's going on? Where are they from?  BEN:  They're from Vagina!  EMMA:   WHAT????   LORI:  (walking back towards the gang, still laughing) Well, technically, we're  all  from there, if you think about it....  C.J.:  That is fantastic! I'm going to have to use that. That's where I'm telling people I'm from from now on. I'm from Vagina.   EMMA:  Is he for real?  LORI:  I don't know, but you can bet I'm going to look that up on the internet tomorrow...actually, forget that, I'm looking that up as soon as I get home!  STU:  Is he really serious? Or just drunk? Did he really say that?  LORI:  I just let a man from Vagina use my digital camera. Damn!  C.J.:  (to RANDOM MAN'S WIFE) So, whereabouts in Canada are you from again?   RANDOM MAN'S WIFE:  Vagina. Vagina, Saskatchewan.  C.J.:  Right, thanks.  STU:  Unreal...   LORI starts shaking with laughter again, exiting stage. Tears are streaming down her face.    STU:  What a night. Good party, good fireworks, good champagne, and we've met someone from Vagina!    Ten minutes later, after much thinking about pens, T-shirts, postcards and other souvenirs saying, "Welcome to Vagina.."     LORI:  Ohhh, I just had a flashback from elementary school.  Crap, I think they must have said RUH-JIE-NUH, not VUH-JIE-NUH...I remember the teacher telling us that the capital of Saskatchewan was Regina, but she pronounced it RUH-GEE-NUH. Either she just told us the wrong way of saying it, because she didn't know any better, or she knew better than to tell us RUH-JIE-NUH because she knew we'd  have a slew of VUH-JIE-NUH jokes.   STU:  (sad) So, it's Regina, not Vagina?   LORI:  I know....I'm disappointed too. Oh well - we can always neglect to tell people this part of the story....and let them believe in Vagina...    FADE OUT.     THE END    Okay, how immature am I? I'm 25 years old and this occurred over 3 days ago and I'm still cracking up as if it was happening the first time!  Why did I have to remember my Canadian Province capitals and ruin it for everyone? (See, I know it's hard to believe, but Americans do actually have to learn capitals of things outside of America occasionally!) We're too old for Santa and the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, but for 15 minutes, we had... urlLink Vagina ....
