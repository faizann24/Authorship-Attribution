We're online!    urlLink     Hallelujah! We finally got the damn digital camera to communicate with my stupid computer and the pics are going online! We have no idea why it worked this time. We've decided not to question the computer gods that be...This pic was taken at Chris' party a week and a half ago - (aside, today is Kristen's 2 week anniversary! Yay! My brain is totally not functioning and Kristen is sitting next to me and giving me sympathetic looks as I start to type something but can't remember what I wanted to type---working on like 3 hours of sleep here! All I have to say is, how cute is Kristen and how frigging big are my lips? ;)  urlLink Get the bigger version!  (Warning: Lips may appear larger in the rear view mirror!)   urlLink    Okay, I have no idea who the guy on the far left is, but he was really funny to talk to. Chris is the partyholder in the middle, and I'm the 14 year old looking 24 year old on the right. That's my butterfly in the shape of an american flag shirt. I'm not much of a stars and stripes wearer, but the american butterfly was too cute to ignore.  Cheers!

We all know that cabbies account for a good 50% of the freaks I meet! :) p.s.

So what I am trying to say is, I still look like a hippie ;) |  urlLink  Enlarge photo  | E
