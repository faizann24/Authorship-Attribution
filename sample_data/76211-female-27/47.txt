urlLink    Well, well, well. Hasn't someone been naughty by not updating her blog in ages? First things first, I was born lazy and that certainly hasn't changed this year. Secondly, I've been too busy to blog (old lame excuse). Thirdly, let's just say that a lot of things happening lately weren't exactly bloggable. Nothing particularly scandalous, but the people involved certainly wouldn't appreciate me blogging about them. But I'm trying to make up for all that by being bloggy today. (Notice how I've just used "blog" as a noun, verb, adjective, etc.)   urlLink   The last couple weeks have been fun albeit stressful. I had a round-table interview with Eric Bana last week. He was in town promoting his new movie,  Black Hawk Down  which I found to be pretty effective in portraying the hell of war. It was agonising and gripping to watch, and I think that's what they were going for. My review of the movie and the interview with Eric will be posted on  urlLink Yap  soon. I'll link to it then. The premiere of  Black Hawk Down  was pretty cool. Unfortunately I missed out on the pre-movie drinks/schmoozing fest but I was pleasantly surprised to find a copy of the novel sitting on every seat in the big Hoyts Fox Studios theatre. Very cool. I'll read that next. The movie itself kept me squirming in my seat, almost as much as the cab driver who drove me to the theatre. If I ever get a normal cab driver, I swear I am going to tip him/her, just because. This guy couldn't keep his hands off me, literally. What a punk!
