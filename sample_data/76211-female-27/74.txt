urlLink    Sirs and Madams, I only have time for a Quickie   Last week:  Monday, April 22nd: HUGE thanks to Peter, Gail, and Adrian for coming through for me on such short notice. You guys rock! Wednesday, April 24th: GIGANTIC congrats to Chad on his super bass playing at L'Otel. It was smooth, it was groovy. I would never have guessed he didn't play regularly with the group. Do I sound like a proud mum or what? I hope to see more of you down there at his next performance! Friday: Thanks to the gang for another lovely dinner at the Red Kangaroo. I want to live there! urlLink    Saturday: Happy Belated birthday to Jo, our favourite little gymnast! The Italian food was to die for! I have a funny little old man story. Some elderly man asked me about my hairdo and butterfly clips while I was waiting at the bus stop. He doesn't have the hair to pull it off, sorry! ;)  urlLink   Sunday: Thanks to the umpteenth power to my writer's group. I am feeling very inspired after our last bunch of exercises and I can't wait to see what I come up with this month!  This week: Monday: Experienced Gretel Killeen Rage. (She's the host of Big Brother Australia). Wanted to smack her across the face with her own clipboard, but more about that later.  urlLink   Tuesday: Had the infamous Red Curry Barrimundi with Gavin. We discussed possible names and merchandising for our non-existent band. Jamming and 'recording' to happen. Sometime. :) Wednesday: MEXICAN FOOD! Aye carumba! I've been searching for Mexican food in Sydney for over 3 years (counting my time here in 1998). We went to Cafe Pacifico in East Sydney. Oh. My. God. I nearly cried, the food was so good. Chimichangas....MMMMMMM! Highly recommend. If you want yummy filling food and you like having to be rolled out the door by your friends because you're too full to walk, this is the place to go! Happy B-day to Chris!  urlLink   Today: Had Tenancy Tribunal hearing. In the meantime, I'm not getting kicked out of the apartment, I just have to pay my rent on time (as I do anyway, doh!). Something dodgy is going on though, must investigate further, but all is okay for now. Tonight: Going to see The Church @ the Enmore. Don't think I'll have Gig Rage tonight. In any case, I have a bit of a follow-up to my Gig Rage blurb, inspired by the lovely  urlLink Fidelma .    urlLink    The Photos: From our treks to Bundeena (Royal National Park) and the Blue Mountains. More photos and explanations to be provided when I get a moment (don't hold your breath! :)      urlLink            urlLink     urlLink            As you can see, I've gotten over putting up flattering photos of myself. I look pretty bad in most of these - the honeymoon is over! :)
