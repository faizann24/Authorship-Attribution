My lunch sucked ass!   Can I tell you about the kitchen Nazis at my job?  First of all, we have an immaculate, extra-fabulous cafeteria, better than the hospital/college ones.  We've got a grill, a deli, pizza section, AND hot (home cooked style) food section.  Technically, they close at 3:00, but the Salvadorians have taken over the schedule.  Sort of like black folks working in retail.  WIthin 30 minutes, it's shutdown time...bring yo shit to da regista!  Okay, so I go in to the caf. today only to find that all the grills have been broken down.  We got Felipe scrubbing the grill and Condita saran wrapping all the perishables.  BUT IT'S ONLY 2:00!  They can't be closed and today was quesadilla day.  How could they get away with that.  Obviously because of the holiday, the caf. mgr. must be off.  This is  !!     They were all looking at me as if they were wondering why this big yella gal got an attitude.  You'd have one too if you got all the shit carried out of you on quesadilla Friday.  So I'm forced to settle for this piddly little lunch.  My stomach hurts, my suga is low, and if I pass out here I'm gonna go and slap the chef's hat offa Condita's ass.  Dat's for rolling her eyes.  Do it like Prince did on Lady Cab Driver, "and THIS is for all the times I asked for ketchup and didn't get it, and THIS is for not understanding a fucking thing I say and me having to speak ghetto Spanish, and THAT one's for too much eyeliner at work knowing dayum well you can't see the papas fritas, and ooooh THAT one...THAT one's for the sistas who aint heeya....BEEYATCH!"   I'm sitting here totally dissatisfied, sippin' on coke with too much sizzurp, rationing the shit outta my  urlLink tight assed lunch , looking like I done partied to the remix of "Back Stabbers" by the O'Jays.  This world is so unfair.     Please send all food donations to:   Hawngreh Bitch 2500 Potato Chip Way Spudtown, Idaho 00666   Anything help is greatly appreciated.
