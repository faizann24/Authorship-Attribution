Shall We Dance?   I go to buy coffee this morning and who do I run into?  RICO SUAVE (the flirty constuction dude - Miguel from across the street).  He was standing there watching me cross the street and although I didn't want to have anything to do with him, I just had to pass by.  So he stopped me saying, "Hello gorgeous, why you been dissing me?" I'm thinking..  Did he just say 'dissing'?  Then he goes on to say that I have been avoiding him and I never speak to him anymore.  Mkay buddy...what am I supposed to do or say?  Should I wrap my big thighs around the scaffold and claw my way up just to say hello to your pressed ass?  Or should I simply wait at the constuction site with my ass pressed up against the fence, waiting for you to come over?  UM ...NO!  So I'm looking at him a bit disoriented and explained that I haven't been "avoiding" him, I just haven't seen him.  He then asks if I'd like to do lunch...I avoid the question and then he says, "Do you like to dance?"  WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?  So I ask him for more specifics and he says, "Well I teach ballroom dancing at Arthur Murray and could take you in one of my classes free of charge."  I wish yall could've seen my face.  I looked at this fool like he had gone stark raving mad.  What the hell do I look like taking Fox Trotting classes from a construction worker who moonlights for Mr. Murray?  Nah man...hell naw.  The only Mr. Murry I'm down with is  urlLink him .  That's it!  So finally I tell Rico "Rumba by night" Suave no thanks and that I wont be taking any of his offers because I'm happily committed (not usually my style but I was so blown by then).  Why did he say okay and blew me a kiss.  What's wrong with this freak?  Who blows kisses?  He is such a broken down Rico Suave it isn't even funny.  I need to offer him gaming classes free of charge, cuz he gots none.
