National Licenses     In the wake of the previous attacks, yes America is weighing its options with respect to identifications and licenses.  In my opinion, some of the proposals seem silly to me and I have a suggestion, FOLKS NEED A LICENSE TO HAVE CHILDREN!!  I think women in this country should be given background checks and psychological screenings before they are allowed to have children.  I'm sorry but something has go to stop this  urlLink sick and crazy shit  people in this country are doing.  Wanna talk about terrorism?  How 'bout doing  urlLink sick things  to innocent, helpless children?  I don't think we do enough to stop shit  urlLink like this  from happening.  It makes me so sick.  I chose not to have children yet for very specific reasons (financial stability, location, etc.) and I'm not going to do so until I'm absolute sure I can be responsible for another life for 18 years.  Why do these women think they can just spit kids out and do whatever the fuck they want with them?  Either make their sick asses go through a screening process before they're allowed to get pregnant or impose a mandatory death penaltly (fuck gas, fuck the chair... I say hang their asses and let them choke to death) for  urlLink child abuse  that leads to an innocent child's death.  This shit is really sick!!!
