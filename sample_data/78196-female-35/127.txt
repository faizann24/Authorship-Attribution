I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me     I'm more than a bird:I'm more than a plane More than some pretty face beside a train  It's not easy to be me        Wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie About a home I'll never see       It may sound absurd:but don't be naive  Even Heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed:but won't you conceed Even Heroes have the right to dream It's not easy to be me      Up, up and away:away from me It's all right:You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy:or anything:      I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees      I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me       It's not easy to be me.
