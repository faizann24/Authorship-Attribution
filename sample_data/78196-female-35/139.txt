Save The Last Dance   Today's my last day at this cake job.  So as of Monday, I'll be unemployed, all non-void, walkin round like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd..LOL.  Not worried though.  I'mma surviva, I'm not gon give up!!!  I'm not sure if I wanna work right now or just cruise thru the first quarter of 2002.  Who knows and really who cares.   I'll miss my techno dwarves and especially my boss.  He and I will still be partying together, definitely.  He's a friend like Chucky..lol.  I saw one of  urlLink Big Shoulders'  Soldiers outside today.  Oh how I wanted to slap her 'cross da head.  Oooh I wanted to sooo bad.  They don't know that we're leaving as of today.  I'm sure they'll be glad to hear it.  I pray that I see  urlLink Big Shoulders  out on the street.   I live to tell her off.  I'm not the burning bridge type, but fuck it.  She wasn't my boss anyway, just a bitch I couldn't stand.  Too bad I didn't get a chance to see her outfit before I left.  Dammit Jim!  That's okay.  I lived to talk about  urlLink Big Shoulders  man.  I should publicly post her email address so yall can send messages and harrass the fuck out of her (nah, wont do dat).   I know some of you have asked what happened during my holiday.  I promise, I'll post a Christmas update soon.  Probably like Monday or Tuesday.  My blog entries will definitely change until I find me a new gig.  Thank God I have talent (hand up).  What can I do?  Maybe I can create a Flash cartoon about Big Shoulders and crew.  Or how bout I strip at a truck stop (I'm too fat for a real club..lol).  I wonder if I can find a state where prostitution and drug dealing are legal..LMAO  That'll work.  I can see it now, a hoe who sells blow..LOL.  Great, I'm a natural born criminal.  Go figure.
