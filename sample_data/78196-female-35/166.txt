urlLink   Chillin' (Literally)   Hold me, I'm cold!  It's late, I'm up cuz it's 10 below zero in this place.  I refuse to double layer my warm fuzzies!  I can't do it tonight.  Now I have insomnia like a somebitch and I'm sitting here typing 10 wpm cuz my fingertips are numb.  I person should not have to live like this?  Freezing fucking cold.  And Shayde's fat ass (my cat) is looking at me with sleepy eyes, prolly laughing at me on the inside.  SO WHAT FATTY CATTY!  JUST CUZ YOU GOT A FUR COAT ON, DON'T MAKE YOU CUTE!  What would he do if I threw him outside to live on his own.  It's a dayum shame I got a grown cat in here who still can't take care of himself.  Did I ever tell yall he's addicted to  urlLink fishies ?  ADDICTED.  Evermean spoiled him because she gives him 15 at a time just so he can hold all of them in his cheeks and choke to death.  Yall..this freakin' cat actually scoops all the fishies up into his mouth with his paws, holds them in his cheeks, and looks around like somebody's gonna take them from him.  Did he grow up in prison.  It's not that serious.    Back to the  Cold and the Pitiful , I'm about to stop breathing. I should go in the room and jump in bed with Tini, I'll bet she's warm.  Plus she's got a really thick duvet.  Fuck!  I forgot she's got a gentleman caller tonight. It's got to be colder in here than it is outside!  It's just gotta be!    Please lawd don't let me have to gather 'round a cigarette to keep warm.
