Fast Ass   I could choke the life outta my girl!  Now we all know that around Christmas time we don't usually buy nice things for ourselves for fear that you might get it as a gift.  NOT HER!!!!!! GRRRRRR  She goes out and buys herself a nice pair of  urlLink these .  How bout that was  one  of the gifts I bought her.  So you know that after she told me that, I was forced to spill the beans.  I could snap her little yella neck in half man.  Me?  When Christmas comes around, I never buy myself the fresh shit (thanks Big Reds..lol).  I wont spend a grip on myself just in case someone else buys it for me, ya know?  So I've been penny pinching on EBay, overlooking the nicer things for fear of upstaging my own potential gifts.  But not Evermean!  She gotta go out and get her a fresh pair of Timbos!     On a lighter note, she asked me what I wanted for Christmas.  I told her that based on my history with Christmas, I make it a point to not ask for anything.  Whatever she gets me will be greatly appreciated (coming from a person who always had a fucked up Christmas).  Yesterday, Big Reds told me about a bracelet and once she described it, I realized that was the bracelet I've been searching for all this time!  I was gonna buy it for myself though.  If Evermean insists on buying it, I just may let her do that.  I should be an ass and play a dirty trick on her.  Instead of having her buy me  urlLink this one , I'll ask for  urlLink this one .  That'll make her piss her pants...LMAO
