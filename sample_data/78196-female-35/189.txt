Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to my fellow blog slut, Crazy Tracy of  urlLink crazytracy.com !  I just love her!  First of all, she's funny as hell and secondly, I live by her  urlLink blog .  Yall have got to read some of that stuff, especially in her archives.  It's so good to know that someone else understands crazy folks but also finds humor in just about everything.  Tracy, here's to you girl!  See, my problem is..I've been missin' her blog entries and am now suffering from stage one withdrawal symptoms.  Tracy what's the cure??  If I lived in her town, I'd probably be crazy and admitted to her facility.  I think she'd take good care of me..sneak me psycho drugs and make me laugh...LOL.  She just has to make sure that they have big straight jackets for us extra chunky butts.  I found these questions on her site, so here are my answers.  If yall see Crazy Tracy out there, tell her that it's time for my meds!  Please..I'm freakin! LMAO      1. WHAT ARE A FEW OF YOUR FAVORITE CHRISTMAS SONGS?   I hate Christmas music (except Merry XMas Baby)       2. WHAT IS A TRADITION THAT YOU STILL CELEBRATE FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD?  . Being depressed on XMas Eve..lol     3. WHAT IS A NEW TRADITION YOU CELEBRATE NOW?  I get drunk as humanly possible, party with old Jewish women in Atlantic City and pass out.     4. WHAT WAS THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT YOU EVER GOT AS A CHILD?   A 2-carat diamond bracelet from my old boyfriend (considered pawning it at least 20 times) - as a child, my family never took that holiday seriously...dont ask...lol      5. IF YOU COULD GET ONE THING THIS YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS (OR HANUKKAH OR KWANZAA OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU CELEBRATE), WHAT WOULD IT BE? (And please, none of that world peace shit. We're trying to boost the economy here.)  Those boots underneath this post.  (hee hee hee)
