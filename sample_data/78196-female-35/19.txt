ALL FALL DOWN   Okay, let me explain why I haven't blogged in a few days.  Well let's begin with Monday and I'll go back later.  Mkay  urlLink this happens  right before I go home from work.  I knew it was raining but I had no idea that a twister dropped down nearby.  That explains why my big ass met the concrete Monday at around 5:15 pm.  See, I left my building and attempted to walk toward the Metro.  But NOOOOO, that's not the way it all went down.     I went towards the door and saw that it was pouring down raining like crazy.  So after purchasing an umbrella for 8 bux, I decide to go outside ANYWAY.  I'm walking out, looking in my purse for my Metro card and realize I am in a puddle of water. Mkay, wind blowing, raining cats and dogs, and me with umbrella and two bags in tow.  Once I realize how deep the water is getting, my big ass decides to run to the left trying to escape with both arms occupied.  Suddenly, just when I thought I was free, my foot went another way.  Still in denial, I refuse to let my bags or my ass go down so I try to break the fall.  In doing so, I fall all the way down on one shoulder completely submerged in water (on my left side).  I'm literally lying in water, cigarette butts, and dirt.  Meanwhile, a little Asian lady (the only one who cared..others just stared), came to my aid to see if I was okay.  "Do I look okay lady?!!  Do you not see me lying here looking like Flipper's big sister?"  NO!  That's not what I said.  I just told her no thanks and to run along so I wouldn't attract more attention to myself.  She fled as I tried to get up wiff all my dayum bags.  We're not even gonna talk about the umbrella.     So with my drenched bags, umbrella, and all, I marched my clogs to the Metro drenching wet.
