Today's Dedication   I dedicate today to my Hamo wife down under, Ms. Breeda Tau'a!  First of all, I miss her like crazy and secondly, just when I began to worry about her, she goes and does it again!    urlLink Her friggin' girlfriend is hot !!!!  WORK BREE!!!  I'm proud of you honey, trust me.  I knew you had it in ya girl.    See we go way back and she and I have been long distance "girlfriends" for a while now.  We're both worry worms so we constantly contact each other for the good-friend-check-in but because I'm practically married, I haven't been able to uphold my duties with calling her more frequently.  She knows I love her though and had it not been for 9/11's attack, she would've been here by now.  Well, I'm so glad that she finally found happiness because it is so deserving.  So FERN listen up girlfriend!  You better take care of my sweetie and make me proud or I'm gonna have to rent a llama and come git cha!  LOL     So I dedicate this day to Bree from Australia because I am so proud of her accomplishment.  I love you sweet buns!!!!   Oh yeh, and Fern...um......WOW!!!!!!   Officer Evermean, Tini and I will eventually come to AU to party with you girls.  As soon as we smoke Bin Laden's ass out...lol  So until then, hold it down yall!!!!!
