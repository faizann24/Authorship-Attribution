I took my nephews  urlLink school shopping  last night.  It amazed me to see kids running about getting things for the new school year.  I was overjoyed with satisfaction by merely the look in the boy's eyes as we filled the cart with cool school stuff.     I remember when I was a kid and didn't have the luxuries of your typical elementary school aged child.  My brother and I were forced to wear used clothes, recycled Tough Skins, and packed lunches containing grilled cheese and tuna sandwiches.  I don't know what was wrong with my mom back then.  She had this obcession with putting carbonated sodas in our thermoses, which meant being the center of attention at lunch because kids would clown us.  Why?  Because everything a child does has something to do with running and jumping.  Well, I'd run and jump with my little rusted  urlLink Holly Hobby lunchbox  in tow.  So kids looked forward to lunches just to see my lunch explode.  Craigmont Cola flew all over me and would drench my peter-pan collared shirt while I sat there dumbfounded and humiliated, wondering what kind of drug my mom was on.  It wasn't that she was "on" anything, she did the best she could so her lil yungins could eat.  The only thing was she just didn't understand that soda+running=explosive lunches.  She never said she was a mathematician so I'm not bitter.
