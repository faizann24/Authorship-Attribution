Apology Accepted   I've received a really nice email from  urlLink Ash .  It reads:   hey. ash here. i'm...sorry? just trying to make amends here, honest, and this is the last you'll hear from me, okay? i really did not intend to start anything, and i liked your blog. very different, very unique, and i so totally didn't mean to sound like i was being a disrespectful punkass, okay? i didn't appreciate the comments but i handled them wrong, so. yeah. anyway. my apologies for insulting you and yours. really.      I find that to be sort of unusual.  Anybody else would've been like, "Fuck you bitch! Yeh I said it!" But Ash continued to stress that she had no bad intentions.  Not that she owed me a huge apology, but I can be big enough to recognize realness when I see it.  You keep shit real with me, I'll return the favor.  That's why can respect her gesture.  Po thang didn't have to go that far, so yall leave her alone.  She has her opinions and I have mine.  Yes, I do bitch and moan about everything and everybody under the sun, including myself.  But I don't go out and bash other web logs.  If I don't like them, I move on.  If I do, I link them or speak highly of them.  That's my style.     Again Ash, thanks for the apology and I apologize as well.
