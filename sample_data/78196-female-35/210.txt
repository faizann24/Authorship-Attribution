Back To My Roots   I mean that literally (cuz my hair looks like Ms. Celie at da Juke Jont), but that's not what this post is about.  I've been looking for a few blog rings to join. Maybe just one, who knows.  I took a look at blackblogz and cocoablogz, but still haven't decided where I want to go.  I think EC may need a home dontcha?  There are some cool folks in those rings.   urlLink Hookerdust  and  urlLink PinkPlatinum  make me ill (it's a good thing).  Those mamas can design their butts off, hands down.  They're really motivated, young, and will definitely be more successful at the rate they're going.  Let's see who else, I'm feeling  urlLink What Da Puff  too.  The name got my attention.   urlLink CutieErica  is one of the most interesting ones I've seen.  She's got mad personality (cute too).  I just love it when our younger babies be doin' it.  I'm feelin'  urlLink SistaGirl  too.  She's holdin' it down for us older wimmen...woo hoo!!!  We got some sistas out here blogging their little lives away.  Show them some love.  Yall will always know who my  urlLink favorite lil yungin  is.  She'll forever reign supreme as the high-priestess of black blogs.     I may just join both rings.  Before they become overpopulated (once blogging really hits the hood...lol).  Kidding.  I'm not sure they will be able to deal with my slapstix comedy.   Yall know I make fun of errybody, including myself.   We shall see.
