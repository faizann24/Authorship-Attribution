WOW!!   Stumbled across these lyrics by  urlLink Alice in Chains .  It's a rock/slow jam called Nutshell.  These should be my signature lyrics, especially for this calamitous life of mine:   We chase misprinted lies We face the path of time And yet I fight, and yet I fight This battle all alone No one to cry to No place to call home   My gift of self is raped My privacy is raked And yet I find, yet I find Repeating in my head If I can't be my own I'd feel better dead
