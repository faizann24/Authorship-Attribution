Today's Dedication   I have to dedicate today to  urlLink this lady .  I bought  urlLink her CD  on Friday because I heard a song by her on Internet radio.  I had no idea just how talented she is.  Her music is so beautiful and her lyrics, look for yourself:     I found a way to get over you.  Somedays I can't even awake. I pull the covers over my face I used to wonder how you got the nerve  Well I guess it's true that what they said That all the times you were not there You never cared, that's why...  I burn my candles baby Cuz you burn me out on both ends I burn my candles baby  To ease the pain within You are the reason that I'm Drowning deep in my tears I burn my candles baby So that my heart can heal.       Them shits brought me to tears for real.  This is definitely a woman who has had some serious relationship drama (like myself) and her songs spoke to me.   And the fact that she can "git it" makes it all the better.  She is so  urlLink pretty  and  urlLink hot ,  urlLink mm mm mm !!! Honestly, I think she peeped into my head when she wrote Candles.  Thanks to her imma be a candle-burnin' bitch to get the "haints" off of me from my evil ex's.  Thanks so much Pru!  If any of you have relationship issues, tight chests, and/or sleepless nights, BUY HER CD TODAY!!      Note:  I had to change the font size b/c the scrolling was driving me crazy.  Also, I have to give props to my House Wife for the "she can git it" term.  I stole it from her..lol  THANKS HONEY!
