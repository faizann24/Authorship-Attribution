Bad Hair Day   Yesterday was awful.  First, let me tell you how fucked up my bush is.  See, I've been wearing my hair very short for the past few years and now I've decided to get it twisted or braided.  Because of that, I have to let my hair grow out a little bit so the Weave Lady can grab my shit.  If you are at all familiar with the "in-between stages" of hair, you know that I now have a cat bush.  I mean my bush not only is lopsided, but it's also dry as toast mkay?  So yesterday, I decide that since I didn't have any more gel, I'd use conditioner.  BAD MOVE.   By the time I got to work and my hair dried, it was flaky and white all over plus it wasn't even.  Even after several attempts at tucking the frizzed-out sideburns behind my ear, I was still rocking a thirsty assed chalkbush!  My shit was definitely dehydrated and foul-looking.  To my embarrassment, I forgot that I was using my headphones all day listening to Internet Radio.  So of course, my neglect and failure to pay attention made me board the train after work not knowing my shit was loppy, uneven, and parched.  Why yall?  On top of that, I need a serious eye-brow waxing cuz right now I'm looking like  urlLink this.      My theory for today is to perhaps rename myself because I'm disgusting.  How about Lionel Michael Smith or maybe Officer Nona Evans-Jefferson.  Either way, I should be stripped of all my rights cuz as you can see, my bush was a combination of the following      Notice the shot of the early-morning Michael, and that should give you an idea as to what I'm working with.  That would be my morning hair.  Right now, I'm sporting a Smitty/Lamont combo wiff dry sideburns sticking out like miniature bush balls.  And I got the nerve to have on earrings.  Why?  If anyone has any Afro-Sheen, please email me right away cuz I'm all dried out.
