Not So Sweet Hangover    I feel like a bad blues record, sad, dusty and broken up.  I feel like a big fat ugly  urlLink lady  with a Jheri Curl is singing about me: "dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...she woke up this morning...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...head leanin' to one side...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...tongue stuck to da roof of her mouth....dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...but she gon' let it ride...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...she gotta hit da pavement....dah-nah-nah-nah-nah....get her ass outta bed...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...raised up awf da pilla and da bitch looked half deah-head!  Cuz she got da swole up eyelids, pasty mouth blues!!!"  Yes, that would be me. I wanted to drink wiff da big dawgs last night at the club and to top it off, my sister and her friend came over afterwards and I drank some more.  So now I'm at work looking like I just got finished setting up mics for Silk awf da late-night.  My clothes are wrinkled, my hair is giving Jheri Curl wet look, and I feel  urlLink absolutely nuts .  What's wrong wiff me yall?  I can't move my neck cuz I'm afraid I might have a seizure or something.  It feels so tight and achy.  Like my mattress was filled with beer cans and I aint have no clothes on and tossed and turned all night, that's how I feel.  The shower didn't help and I tried to smoke a cigarette and dayum near passed out.  But why did I have to run for the bus this morning.  I got up to the driver and he asked me if I needed a transfer.  NAW FOOL!  What he should've asked me is if I needed some water.  H2O ponk!  Couldn't he tell that I was dehydrated and since I ran I could've easily collapsed on the S2?  Friggin transfer.  YEH FOOL, TRANSFER ME TO DC GENERAL cuz a big girl feeling mighty low this morning.
