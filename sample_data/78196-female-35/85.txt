urlLink       INTERVENTION - CHIPPER SAVED ME    I went up to meet the UTZ gang, but I was stopped by  urlLink Chipper , from Herr'stown.  He said that I didn't have to listen to the "bad people" and resort to violence.  He told me that I was a good, feeling person and I can love myself.  So I took a minute and read the materials Chipper gave me to make sure this was something I wanted to do.  He said that I wouldn't have to worry about being afraid because him and his  urlLink hombres  would see to it that I was removed from the "list" and my "missions" would cease as soon as I agreed to try them.  Herr's?  I've never done anything with them.  Anyway, he gave me  urlLink these  and said that I'd be much more satisfied with they're stuff.  By joining up with Herr's I was promised protection and the opportunity to connect with other Chipper Club membes and play  urlLink games .  That sounds like fun (hee hee).  I will also get my own security entrance card to get inside the  urlLink headquarters .  I can finish out Chipper's missions and have fun even!  Upon returning to my desk, I looked around for the UTZ bitch.  She was no where to be found and there was NO SEAL TO BREAK.  Because of that, I am now spending quality "crunch time" with Chipper and Company.  THANKS CHIP!!!!
